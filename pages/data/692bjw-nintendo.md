  - Here is a [picture](https://i.redd.it/8pz56kxmpbvy.jpg) of us all enjoying a Grand Prix last night.
  - My sister through some crazy mouth manipulation was able to race in Mario Kart 64 but now she can seriously compete. And I enjoy not having to hold down accelerate, especially when drift braking on 200cc.

  - Who else has great stories about Mario Kart being more accessible than ever?
- Comment
  - Nintendo has proven accessibility and hardcore gaming can comfortably coexist again and again... As Iwata said, everyone is a gamer.
