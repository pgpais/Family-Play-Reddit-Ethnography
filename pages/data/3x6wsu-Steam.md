- Title
  - Mom here (be nice) A+ recommendation for Steam Link and Steam controller
- Post
  - My son and I got Steam Link and controllers as a shared gift for each other for the holidays. Just have to say it's the best thing ever. We've had a shared Steam library for a while (500 games between us) and have on occasion dragged one of our PCs out to the living room to play together on Big Picture. But tonight it was truly wonderful, we spent 6 hours playing games and laughing and showing each other cool things on games we each like. A very nice change from both of us playing in different rooms all the time. Not saying that hanging out with the mom is going to be his new favorite thing, but this sure does make it easier to share our games when we have free time at the same time. This will sound stupid, but when he was a young kid we played Yugi-oh together a lot, we both had decks and would spend entire days trading and battling. When he outgrew that, he went solo into Steam gaming and I did too, and anyway I miss having a common hobby. Tonight we got midway into 3 different multi player games and I do hope we'll keep going when we have time together. Sorry, turned into a stupid mom story, but I think you guys will get what I'm talking about.
