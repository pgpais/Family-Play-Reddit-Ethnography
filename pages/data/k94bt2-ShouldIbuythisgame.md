- Post
	- Saw the post about the guys cousin addicted to fortnite and thought I would ask for overwatch. Both of my sisters 9, and 13 started playing overwatch in the last year and one has over 26 days play time and hasnt owned the game for even a year. I know this is part is on my parents but she literally skips dinner to play overwatch. Last night she tried to skip putting up Christmas decorations but we made her get off. I just want them to play something else i never hear the end of overwatch I’m losing my sanity

	- EDIT: I think I got all of the answers I need for now, I appreciate all of you. I just want the best for them because obviously at a certain point it’s unhealthy. Im going to try getting them to start a tv show with me and try some new games with them!

	- I don't know man, not a lot of games like OverWatch. Do they play single player games? Maybe try borderlands, they can play couch co-op together
