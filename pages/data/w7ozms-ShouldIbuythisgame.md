- Title
  - WSIB to help my wife learn to play
- Post
  - My wife and I lately have been trying to find something to do together instead of watching TV. I hesitantly suggested playing a coop game, but she’s never been into video games. To my surprise she was excited to try. We started playing It Takes Two and to my surprise she’s really enjoying it. I’m just ecstatic to have her playing with me, but she feels bad because it’s all so new to her that most of the time I’m waiting for her to get through an obstacle. I’m totally fine with it, and I know she’ll get better with time. Her biggest problem is controlling the camera. Last night she came to me and unprompted said she would be interested in playing more games after we finish It Takes Two. Any suggestions for local coop that would help her get better at learning the controls? Anything on PC, PS4 or switch would be good. Also I’d be open to it if it has cross play between those systems. I’ve also got game pass for PC so bonus points if it’s on there.
