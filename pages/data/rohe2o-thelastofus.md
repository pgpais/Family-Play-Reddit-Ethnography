Title
My mother has been crying for 15 minutes after finishing part 2

Post
In the beginning of the year, I decided to play The Last of Us with my mom (I played and she watched) and she actually LOVED the experience. She really fell in love with Joel and Ellie's relationships and characters and was deeply invested in the story. 

Months later I told her that there was a second game (I had it already but only later I let her know) and she was super excited to play it with me.

Boy she says this was her most intense experience with any media in her life. In the beginning of the game when Joel died, she cried like she had lost a relative. She was super pissed at Abby for a while but then, when Abby spared Ellie's life and went to Santa Barbara with Lev, my mom said she didn't want to kill her anymore, so obviously the final showdown was super intense for her. After the ending (specially the last flashback) mom almost died in tears.

It's crazy how my mom, who is a super serious person and never really cries watching movies, felt so emotional during the gameplay. I think that's what videogames can do to you, sometimes their stories can be even more immersive and interesting than actual movies, even to older people like my mom. You should definitely play it with someone who is older, I'm sure they'll even catch some things that not even you noticed on your first plays (this happened to me).

Also, do you recommend any other games with profound and emotional stories and characters for me to play with her? Before we ended she said she wanted to do this again with other games.
