	- She's 13 and I'm frequently traveling with my son to baseball tournaments, so I like to check in on her as much as possible. However, I know how upset she gets when I call her during a battle or whatever while she's playing Overwatch. Is there an app to text her or call her through her headset while she's playing?

	- Thank you.
	- EDIT: Thank you so much for all your helpful replies. I have installed the Xbox app on my phone and we tested it out. Good to go.

	- I don't have any gold to give any of you, best I can do is three free hours of hitting lessons for any ballplayers you might have. ðŸ˜œ
