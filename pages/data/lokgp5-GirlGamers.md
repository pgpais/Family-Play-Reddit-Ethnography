	- I've been playing Pokemon Go pretty consistently since 2016. I take breaks during the winter but I really enjoy getting out in my city.
	- It's a sloowwwwwww building game. Every day you play counts and it is really hard to achieve things in it without spending money or spoofing.
	- Well my husband plays too and for a belated Valentine's day we bought the community day passes together. Something came up and I was only gonna be able to do the last few hours of it. Well he decided to login to my account for me and 'help' me by getting out when I couldn't and doing ALL the raids for me.

	- By the time I got to get on and play it today he had caught me tons of MewTwos. I never had a MewTwo before and have been stuck on the research for it forever but what I love about pokemon go is that it's challenging so when you do achieve something it feels SO AWESOME!
	- So when I logged in today on our Valentine's date evening and saw that there was 9 of them AND a shiny on there I started crying. I was really really upset. He had done other raids for me too and I just...

	- I look at ALL my other pokemon and I remember the days I got them. I remember where I was, which events they were for, setting aside time to go out and get them. They're important to me.
	- I'm just really really upset and he doesn't get it. When I started crying he told me to 'just fucking transfer them then and do the raids yourself.' but he had already used all my special event raids passes.

	- So we went home early and I just need to vent to people who understand how upsetting this is to me. I missed out on this event I wanted to do and now I don't get to see my pokemon getting added to my dex for the first time.
	- I know he was trying to help but I'm really frustrated.

	- Edit: thank you all so much for the support! I appreciate it. Just a note, the comments correctly guessed that my husband was just upset that I wasn't happy with his 'gift'. He has apologized and said he won't touch it again.

	- I mainly just wanted to be validated. Like he plays assassin's creed and he's a completionist. Imagine he spend 4 YEARS on an assassin's creed game And then one day I went and just finished it myself and saved it so he couldn't go back... But clearly everyone here sees my point I just wish he could have before it was too late.
	- Thanks again for all the support! It can't be undone but I do feel a lot better knowing I'm not the only one who finds this upsetting.

	- You were planning to get a Mewtwo. Your husband thought the Mewtwo was the important part, but you were actually looking forward to the getting part. It's crap that you missed out on the part you were looking forward to.
