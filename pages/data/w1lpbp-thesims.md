  - I think my husband wishes he didn't ask
- Post
  - Him: playing the sims?
  - Me: yeah. My girl is pregnant by a werewolf, but she just lied to her husband and told him it was his. Don't feel too bad for him though, he's dating the same werewolf behind her back and I also just found out he has a secret love child from before we got married.
  - Him: _slowly backs out of the room_

  - Ahhh, the family that sims together weirds each other out together. That's love right there. 😁
