  - This is silly and probably doesn't warrant a thread but I was proud this morning when my son, age 6, was all excited after finishing Mario Odyssey. I've only played the game about 10 minutes myself so I don't know how challenging of a game it is, but either way I'm proud of him.

  - He was getting so frustrated last night that he started crying while trying to finish the game. I told him gaming is about having fun from the challenge and that is true in all of life. Life is about struggle and obstacles and true joy is overcoming those challenges and learning from defeat. Well he didn't give up and was all excited this morning after finishing the game.

  - Very impressive work for a 6 year old. You should be proud! Good for him.
