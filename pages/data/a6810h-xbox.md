	- For anyone that was curious, I did end up getting an XBox for my dad! I got it all set up for him with Gold and a bunch of games. I got him all the Battlefields and showed him how to start out with War Stories and the Practice Range. I also downloaded War Thunder as recommended and a variety of other games.

	- He was so excited!! I thought he would argue and complain about me getting him a gift because that's what he usually does. But his eyes lit up when he unwrapped it and he couldn't wait to play it! I showed him how to use it and we played some Rocket League, which he thought was hilarious. He liked that if you crash into each other hard enough someone blows up. He thought the Battlefield graphics were amazing and liked flying the planes through the clouds.

	- After I left I checked on the XBox app occasionally to see if he was still online playing it, and he played until 12:30 AM. My mom texted me and said that "there is a lot of hooting and hollering down there with that battleship game", LOL! Then the next morning he played for several more hours. I laughed because he accidentally recorded some clips of his screen while playing Battlefield V and he was going prone and then standing up over and over, so I think I'll need to give him a few more lessons.
