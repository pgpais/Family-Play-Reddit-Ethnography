  - His last time playing a console was an atari. I watched him play the beginning of COD WWII and it took him like 3 hours to get up the first beach - on easy - so multiplayer is not in the cards right now. What are the best single player games for this console to occupy his time?

  - Little big planet, it's easy and fun
  - Rayman legends it's fun too until half way through the game then it gets stupid hard.
  - One of the football games, if he likes football he can keep playing the game he watched.
  - Flow, Abzu style games. They are relaxing and take you on a beautiful journey.
