- Title
  - My wife shamed me yesterday….and it will not stand!
- Post
  - We are both avid skyrimmers and she was watching me play last night.
    tags:: [[Kinship/Spouse]], [[Shared Experiences/Spectating]]
  - She, without batting an eye, asks me, “how often do you search things that say empty?”

  - The audacity, the unmitigated gall to ask such a thing!
  - Who else out there is touched with the “empty search” affliction?
  - Sadly, the answer to her question was, “pretty much always”
  - Someone talk me out of scheduling an emergency couples counseling session.
  - The most shocking admission of the night, after the torment she put me through, was that she, too, struggles with searching empty vessels.

  - Edit:
  - I am loving this thread, and I was trying to keep up with the comments, but now I must head to dinner with the same wife that has caused me so much harm….looking forward to getting back to it later on hopefully…thanks for making me feel a little more normal
  - Second Edit: I got into a discussion with someone about my wife’s bakery job and some people expressed interest in seeing her work…I don’t know what the rule is on promotions….I shared the instagram profile on a comment, but I didn’t want to put it here…if you’re interested, she does a lot of cakes for kids’ birthdays so they get really creative sometimes…she doesn’t like to post the cakes before the client has the event, so, she hasn’t posted yet, but there’s an awesome spider verse one she’s gonna post soon! Anyway, that’s enough of me promoting, if you are interested, shoot me a DM and I’ll share a link
  - Third edit: Ok…the end is nigh…she just logged in for the first time in over a year, so….watch out for her, she’s really mean

  - I'm always to quick on the draw for the 'E' prompt to pop up long enough. I usually realize it said empty the moment the inventory opens.
