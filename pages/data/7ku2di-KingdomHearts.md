	- [DDD] Played through Dream Drop with my 10 yo handicapped sister...
- Post
	- Took long enough for me to beat this one! It helped that she gave me a day off when I struggled with Young Xehanort. Anyway,  here goes! 
	  
	  * Opening cutscene, and she loves the new graphics. 
	  
	  * "This looks like it's gonna be pretty good."
	  
	  * "Wait. How is Ursula back?"
	  
	  * They start sinking. She rolls her eyes. "Not again..."
	  
	  * "I'm glad they stuck together.  I don't wanna lose Riku again.  Once is enough, thank you."
	  
	  * Named her Meow Wow 'Meowthee'. She's in love. 
	  
	  * Named the Komory Bat 'Midnight'.
	  
	  * Having never played TWEWY, she didn't have much input on the world itself,  although she asked me to show her the game someday. 
	  
	  * Joshua: You know what they say.  Sometimes memories just need a little help getting out. 
	  Her: I've never heard that.
	  
	  * "Once you beat this guy [Hockomonkey], you'll go back to Riku,  right?" 
	  I was finishing each world with one before doing the other. She really liked playing as Riku.
	  
	  * "Ugh. Ansem. But also..   Terra. So that's okay!"
	  
	  * "So, they get the same keyblades? They're so close to each other!"
	  
	  * Joshua grows wings. "What? Where did those come from? Who the heck..."
	  
	  * "La Cité des Cloches? No idea where this is... Ohhh... hunchback." She found the movie kind of boring.
	  
	  * "I've been thinking about Xehanort while you were gone.  Is he really back?" 
	  
	  * "Don't skip the song.  I love the opening song.  If it had words,  I'd sing them all the time."
	  It does.  It's simple and clean. 
	  "Ohhh..."
	  
	  * I have to explain the concept of Sanctuary to her. She thinks it's a great idea,  as Esmeralda is safe now. 
	  
	  * Quasimodo: Now my heart is free forever. 
	  Her: well, yeah,  cuz Frollo is dead. 
	  
	  * Named her Wheeflower 'Florgeous'.
	  
	  * *fights Commantis second time*
	  "Too bad we don't have the lasers on the bike."
	  We don't need them. *dies 4 times*
	  "You sure we don't need the lasers, MidnightKoi?"
	  
	  * *Sam and Quorra leave,  leaving Flynn behind*
	  *she starts crying*
	  
	  * Names her R&R Seal 'Bubble'.
	  
	  * *explains how a heartless,  like Xehanort's heartless,  and a nobody,  like Xehanort's nobody,  turn back into a person when vanquished* 
	  
	  *She rolled her eyes as she realized Xehanort is back*
	  
	  * *uses Lucky Dice twice*
	  I can see why you like R&R Seal.
	  
	  * "I recognize that sigh. That means you don't wanna do this part.  Every time you do that sigh,  you die 8 times." 
	  (I sighed when I saw Lord Kyroo)
	  
	  * She really likes Chaos Snake. 
	  
	  * *huge grin when we Bubble Burst Monstro*
	  
	  * *at the end of Riku in Monstro*
	  "He has a dream eater picture on his back. Why?"
	  
	  
	  * Joshua: Riku,  there's something you need to know 
	  Her: What,  that you can grow angel wings? 
	  
	  * "Are you sure Joshua is a guy?"
	  
	  * Chakram fly out to save Mickey. 
	  "Again?!?" *huge grin* "My name is Lea, and I'm back,  baby! " (He's her favorite,  thankfully)
	  
	  * Named her KO Kabuto 'Bradley'.
	  
	  
	  * *Room of elephants in Mount Saint-Michel* 
	  "What is this,  a circus?"
	  
	  * Beagle Boys show up. 
	  "Ugh, do we have to fight these three dorks again?"
	  
	  * "What did Lea ask for?"
	  You'll see. 
	  "I can't wait!"
	  
	  * She loves saying All for One, One For All.
	  
	  * She sang along to the entire Fantasia world.
	  
	  * *beat Chernabog in 1 minute* That was the boss.
	  "Wait,  what just happened?"
	  
	  * She guesses Lea asked for a keyblade before we even go to TWTNW. I stay quiet.
	  
	  * Named her Tubguin 'Pablo'.
	  
	  * "THAT'S why Xigbar has yellow eyes!  That's... FIVE XEHANORTS."
	  
	  * "Bye,  Xemnas. Time to die again!"
	  
	  * "Why do you keep dropping and playing Sora?"
	  
	  *finishes Sora, drops to Riku,  I point out the missing drop gauge*
	  "Oh, cool." *doesn't care*
	  
	  * Riku was a dream eater the whole time. 
	  
	  *huge grin* "I knew it."
	  
	  * "We only know six darknesses! This is why I always say to take off their hood!"
	  
	  * "I think the seventh light is kairi!"
	  
	  * She got all three questions right on Destiny Islands. 
	  
	  * "Seriously,  he lost Sora AGAIN?"
	  
	  * *Lea gets his keyblade*
	  
	  *inaudible squealing. From both of us,  admittedly*
	  
	  * *watches secret movie* "I KNEW IT WAS KAIRI!"

	- **FINAL THOUGHTS:**
	- Pretty good.
	- Game looked hard,  but you still need to teach me to play.
	- Story was good, except for the Grid. Riku's side was sad.
	- Master Riku is really cool!
