My sister was watching me play Skyrim and asked why Serana was wearing a hood

Post
I tell her that she is a vampire and exposure to the sun can harm her skin. She then says 'Then why are half of her boobs exposed?' 

Never even thought of that to be honest...

I thought it was to hide the fact she was a vampire when you travel through populated areas. Cover her face and the like.
