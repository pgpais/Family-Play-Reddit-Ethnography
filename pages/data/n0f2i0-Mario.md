Does anyone else wish we could get the NEW Super Mario Bros Wii on to the switch? I lost my copy of the game years ago and it was my childhood and I have memories of playing it with my family, I know the NEW Super Mario Bro's thing isnt the most liked but it was my childhood, wish I could replay it

I would love to see some New super mario games come to switch. Iâ€™m in a similar boat as you because I lost my copy of the 2d game on the DS.
