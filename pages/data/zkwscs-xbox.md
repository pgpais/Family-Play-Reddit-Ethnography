  - Game for father/son?

  - I’m looking for a game that’s good for two players, that’s suitable for an 8 year old boy. We’re ok with some violence, he plays Fortnite but no blood or gore. A game similar to Fortnite would be awesome. I don’t play but my husband’s a gamer and it’s a gift for them.

  - I know it’s not like Fortnite, but when I was younger I used to play the LEGO games with my older brother. Any one of them is great and is perfect for 2 players
