	- Hey all, I want to play a game with my wife that isn't mechanically difficult with plenty of crafting/building/progression.

	- We recently finished playing Stardew Valley. Wow, what a hit. She loved it and really enjoyed the building, exploration, crafting, progression and decorating. She enjoyed the combat well enough, but that wasn't the main thing.

		- Minecraft Concerns - lack of theme/story and it would be her first experience with First-Person camera.
		- Valheim Concerns - The emphasis and difficulty of combat. Can she spend her time mining and chopping down trees while I farm bad guys? If she wants to join fighting, will she just get killed all the time?

	- Thanks and I appreciate the help!

	- Hey all, it looks liked Minecraft is the winner in votes and in your explanations. We're going to download the game and have our first session this evening! Woot! Super excited.
	- Maybe later this year when she's more comfortable with the controls we'll try Valheim.
	- As a BONUS: Are there any must-have mods you would suggest for co-op Minecraft? Ideally these mods would give clarity and direction. Stardew Valley had quests, which helped with direction.

	- We had our first session this evening. It's 100% new to both of us, but I have the benefit of a lifetime of video games. So, understandably, it's a steep learning curve. At this point she has made doors for our little cave and is enjoying picking up all sorts of stuff outside (especially those trees!). We've got a crafting table and smelter, and that's about it.

	- I was blown up by a guy but thankfully she didn't really notice. I'll give more updates as we progress if people actually want that.

	- I voted for Minecraft.
	- In valheim She could mostly focus on mining and gathering stuff, but there is a really good chance she would get killed quickly in any of the later game biomes. Also she would be doing A LOT of gathering as that’s about 75% of the game in my experience as someone who has beaten the 4th boss. Most of the game feels like gathering and organizing. Also the combat isn’t very fun in my opinion. I like the game and it’s really fun at times, especially with friends, but it’s almost more irritating than anything to me lol

	- Minecraft is more beginner friendly. The combat is fairly easy, there is no maximum carry weight, you’re never in any more danger than you want to be in per se. also the base building, mining, and farming is generally more enjoyable in Minecraft

	- TL;DR valheim is a bit frustrating and so far it’s not all that full of content while Minecraft has better progression, simpler combat and more To work on around the base.
