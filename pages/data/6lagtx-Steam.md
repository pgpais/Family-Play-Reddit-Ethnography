	- Steam Family Sharing should warn you when try to launch a game that someone is currently in the middle of using your library.

	- I loaded up some Rainbow Six: Siege and was in the middle of a match when there was a rapid knocking on my door followed by my sister bursting into my room. Turns out she was in the middle of the true final boss in Undertale (via my copy) but needed to run to the store real quick and so left the game up. She came back to a Windows prompt telling her she had been forcibly booted from her game session. And I had no idea, since my friends list was set to offline at the time.

	- So long as Steam doesn't allow to to play *any* of a person's games when they're playing, despite whatever game they're in, the library owner should be warned before trying to launch something. I already know the borrower will be given a five-minute warning or so when the owner launches a game, but the problem is that she wasn't there at the time to see it.

	- me and my sister also share libraries: I play offline if the game she wants to play is in my library and vice versa. 
	  but I agree you should get a warning too.
