- Title
  - Non-gaming Wife Plays GTA V
- Post
  - So I asked my wife to play GTA V last weekend and she agreed since she knew there were some nice cars in the game. (Her father is a mechanic) She started slowly with the controls and started getting used to them.

  - Taking a cruise up in the Hills and the surrounding areas careful to follow the red lights at intersections if she could help it. I told her she wouldn't get in trouble for running them. She then proceeded to speed up and get lost in the world.

  - Now, my wife is not a horror movie watcher and even squirms at rape scenes in shows especially before bed. So when she pulls up to a corner and a women calls for help to her left on the curb down the street, I start to go for the controller telling her I should do something real quick so she could go about her drive. She yanks the controller away and floors the car - straight towards the two men, one of which is mounted ontop of the poor woman. My wife jumps the curb and slams on the gas and hits a bump JUST enough to clear the woman's head who is on the ground and hits the guys head with such force it was almost as loud as my jaw hitting the ground.

  - It was just so precise and calculated that I just couldn't believe how much of a killer hero my wife could be. So proud.
