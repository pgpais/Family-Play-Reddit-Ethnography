- Title
  - I’m a 43 year old father who is not into gaming at all. My, soon to be, 9 year old son will be getting an Xbox for his birthday. He is way into gaming, I’m hoping to find a game we can play together that would appeal to both of us. Any suggestions?

  - The LEGO games can be fun for all ages. I recommend LEGO Star Wars.
