The "one player per library" on Steam's Family Sharing service doesn't seem like sharing at all.

Post
My nephew was stoked when I set him up with a new account on Steam and shared my library. Originally I thought Steam would allow multiple users per library and just limit games to one player at a time. Nope. The concept is great but the reality is kind of sad. He either gets kicked from his game when I start playing or I feel guilty and just go do something else. I know it's a first world problem but still... Seems a bit lame in my opinion. What do you guys think?

The problem is that's not what Family Sharing is meant for. It's meant for a Steam Machine-style situation where you have one box per household with multiple users, kind of like having multiple Live accounts on an XBox. In that scenario it works fine because you *can't* have more than one user at a time so no one is kicked off. It's disappointing because it seems like it would be analogous to lending your buddy your copy of Goldeneye, but they've instead decided to make it like lending your buddy your whole N64. While they've never claimed anything to the contrary, they really should make how it works clearer because you're not the first to expect that functionality from the system.
