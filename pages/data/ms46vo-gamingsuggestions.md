  - My 13 year old is playing Fortnight, Mine craft etc on his phone and now canâ€™t play with his buddies anymore who are on an Xbox or play station. I looked at the PlayStation but $1000 is a bit steep for a game. He is a great kid who never asks for anything so is there anything a little more affordable?

  - You can get a used PS4 or Xbox for $300 or so and fort nite is a free download game. Now if you are looking for a PS5 or the new Xbox, you may wait a couple months. The $1000 systems you are seeing are second hand markets due to limited supply. The systems should only cost $500 but people are price gouging.
