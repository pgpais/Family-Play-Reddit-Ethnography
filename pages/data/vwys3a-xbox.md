  - We each have separate consoles, but playing on one is do able. He likes shooters and enjoyed tiny Tina's wonderlands. I enjoy games like valorant and Minecraft. Preferably on game pass, free, or cheap. Any suggestions are appreciated!! ðŸ™ƒ

  - It takes two is one of the best co-op games ever made. You should give it a try. I believe it's on gamepass.
  - Also the overcooked series is pretty fun, it requires a lot of organization and patience.
  - Moving out is also excellent. Same developers of overcooked.
  - None of them are shooters, but I've enjoyed them all a lot.
