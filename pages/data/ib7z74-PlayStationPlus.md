Title
Marvel Avengers PS+ and Family Account

Post
My two little boys just fell in love with the Beta. We actually all played together earlier and was awesome. 

&nbsp;

I understand we will all need a copy of the game to play together but can someone help clarify if we are all going to have to each get a PS+ subscription? I am the family manager for their PSN accounts.

I wish there was a way to discount things of this nature for families in the same household. Thank you in advance.

If you're playing on the same consoles, obviously the answer is no. If you're in three separate consoles, you'll need at least 2 active PS+ accounts. What you'll have to do is activate one of their playstations as your main account's primary console. This allows for everybody on that console to play your games and access multiplayer without you needing to be logged in. At the time, there's no way to activate multiple primaries at once
