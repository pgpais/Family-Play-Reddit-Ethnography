  - Looking to buy my Dad a wheel to play racing games on PS4. Need some help.
- Post
  - Hey guys and gals,
  - My Dad absolutely hates most video games. He'll watch me play, but what would get him to play video games is to play racing games. However, he won't play without a wheel because the controller would feel wrong.

  - Can any one help me on choosing a wheel and pedal set that isn't really expensive to buy. Also, good games that will go with them. I don't want to buy all that stuff and find out none of the games work. I generally know nothing about the whole racing/wheel stuff when it comes to gaming. My pop has been going through so much bullcrap that I feel I need to get him something cool. I mentioned it in passing and he said "You'd never get me off those games."
