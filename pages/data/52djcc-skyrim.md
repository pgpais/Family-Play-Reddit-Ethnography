- Title
  - My 7 year old nephew wanted a bed time story last night
- Post
  - He very much enjoyed the tale of a warrior named Ognar waking up as a prisoner unsure of what crime he'd committed, and is attacked by a Dragon. I left out the part with the head rolling off, but he liked the part where Ognar leaped out of a tower into a burning building with his hands tied, and he really didn't like Hadvar. We ended with him fighting a bear in the caves, so I guess tonight we're heading to whiterun!

  - "Ah," said Ognar, "a defenceless chicken..."
