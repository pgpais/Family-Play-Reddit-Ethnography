  - I got Ori and the Blind Forest during the sale and now my wife is basically playing her first Metroid game.
- Post
  - This is such a great game! We are having so much fun. She’s played more than me so far but watching her I realized it’s just an amazing Metroidvania game.

  - Might I then suggest looking at Axiom Verge? If you like Metroid style games.
