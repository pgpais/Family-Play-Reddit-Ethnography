Title
Looking for games to play with my wife - PC/PS4/Switch

Post
Hi ya'll!


My wife isn't a gamer or very good at playing games, but she really enjoys playing with me.
Recently we've mostly played **Super Mario Party** & **MK8DX,** as well as the newest **Crash** on PS4.

English isn't her first or second language, and sometimes she's having a hard time timing the button pushes (or just finding the right buttons first), she even preferres to just use the D-pad rather than analog stick for movement.

Despite these "limitations", she really wants to play games that are similar with the ones we've already played for quite some time.

I've thought of plugging my PC in to our living room TV just so we could play games on that as well, but I really don't know what games we'd play on that, so I'll take recommendations on that side as well.


TL;DR 
I'm looking for:
* Platforming (Preferably 2D)
* Casual racing

Edit: Wow, I never thought I'd get this many responses & solid suggestions as well. 
Thank you all, I have a whiteboard full of titles to show my wife.

Comment
Some casual co-op platformers.

- Chariot

- A Hat in Time
