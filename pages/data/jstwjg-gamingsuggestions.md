- Title
  - Looking for games to play with my wife - PC/PS4/Switch
- Post
  - Hi ya'll!
  - My wife isn't a gamer or very good at playing games, but she really enjoys playing with me.
    Recently we've mostly played **Super Mario Party** & **MK8DX,** as well as the newest **Crash** on PS4.

  - English isn't her first or second language, and sometimes she's having a hard time timing the button pushes (or just finding the right buttons first), she even preferres to just use the D-pad rather than analog stick for movement.

  - Despite these "limitations", she really wants to play games that are similar with the ones we've already played for quite some time.

  - I've thought of plugging my PC in to our living room TV just so we could play games on that as well, but I really don't know what games we'd play on that, so I'll take recommendations on that side as well.

  - TL;DR
    I'm looking for:
    - Platforming (Preferably 2D)
    - Casual racing
  - Edit: Wow, I never thought I'd get this many responses & solid suggestions as well.
    Thank you all, I have a whiteboard full of titles to show my wife.
