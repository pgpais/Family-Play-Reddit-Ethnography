  - The look my brother gave me...

  - I just finished the game today, and now he has just begun on his own profile. A while later I walked into the kitchen and he stood there for a few seconds looking at me. I knew exactly what he just played and the emotion was simmering in his eyes.

  - He just said "I'm taking a break..."
  - Our mom asked what was wrong and I replied "You wouldn't understand, it's okay."

  - I've rarely seen him this way, even when grieving real life tragedies. This little moment is a testament to just how hard-hitting this game is. It's amazing, thanks Naughty Dog.

  - You should have shared it with your mom (if you could). I'm surprised he was able to stay spoiler free with another player in the house. Good for you for not spilling the beans.
