- Title
  - Confused Mom here, help!
- Post
  - My son plays on Steam, and he tells me he only gets an hr to play. But he can buy more hours daily?
  - I'm not understanding I guess...this is coming from a mom that played Atari, Nintendo, Sega...you get it. Is there not a simple one payment, play as much as you want option? Need some clarification on this, Google didn't help.
  - **UPDATE: So he wasn't lying, he has a Chromebook and uses Nividia(?) to play Steam on. Moms is gonna have to shell out for a new laptop. THANK YOU for all the replies! We both got a kick out of reading the funny replies.**

  - Does he play at a cyber cafe or are you in a country that limits access?
  - If so, that's not something steam controls.
  - If not, there is a miscommunication.
