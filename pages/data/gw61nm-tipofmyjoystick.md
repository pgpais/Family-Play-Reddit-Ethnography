- Title
  - [Wii][2008] Please help my aunt remember this game she’d watch my Uncle play
- Post
  - Sorry if formatting is off. Mobile and all. So what she remembers about the game is it’s third person, white male protagonist, possibly zombies, guns and knives as weapons. Open world. Has kind of an early America theme, with western towns and saloons, whiskey barrels. But could also stumble upon cabins in the woods. Any help would be much appreciated!
