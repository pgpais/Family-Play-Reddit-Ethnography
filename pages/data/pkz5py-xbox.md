Title
Gamepass Needs a Family Plan

Post
 

EDIT: **Yes, I am aware that the Gamepass subscription is shared on the CONSOLE.** But it is not shared anywhere else (Cloud, PC, other Consoles). My wish below is above and beyond this.

\---------------------

Let me start this by putting it out there that I am a huge fan of Game Pass. It has allowed us (and especially impulsive/impatient me) to try SO MANY games. I am subscribed to Game Pass Ultimate for the next 3 years. I have an Series X, and play on cloud (with sincere appreciation for the ability to do so!) on my Android Tablet and multiple PCs (whatever PC I am really near, which should show you how ACCESSIBLE it is and feels awesome!)

But here comes the part where I should qualify my demographic: I am a husband of a wife, and a father of 2 kids who play RELIGIOUSLY. This means our Xbox is frequently in use on our one entertainment center TV. This also means I (the Game Pass Subscriber) appreciate even more the Cloud Play functionality, but it also means **I am the one who gets kicked off the Xbox more often, because I am the subscriber and I can use Cloud Play on any device.**

Here we are at the topic of my suggestion: **BRING IN A FAMILY PLAN FOR GAME PASS, OR ALLOW SHARING WITH A LIMITED NUMBER OF FAMILY MEMBERS!**

In families sharing a house, the traffic on the Xbox is nothing to sneeze at. I want to be the one using the Xbox sometimes. I want to kick the little ones off the TV sometimes and have them cloud play!

Yes, I recognize that if they allow that, it will be abused. But I think it will ultimately drive more Game Pass subscription sales.

Discuss! Do you think this is a good or bad idea? If you agree, please bring this feedback to Microsoft as I am!

I agree that it would be a good idea. Phil Spencer has said it's something they'd like to do: -

However, I wouldn't read much into that, cos he's said that about other things that have never actually materialised. I think sometimes he just likes to answer tweets in a way where he doesn't have to say "Nope, not happening".
