- Title
  - [BBS] Played BbS with my handicapped 10yo sister...
- Post
  - The long awaited next entry! I considered doing one for each character, but she had less reactions to some, due to getting some of their story already from previous stories. Here goes! NOTE: We played all stories on Proud, and only looked up command melding for Aqua, since I knew she had the most necessary planning.

  - **TERRA**
  - "What's birth by sleep mean?"
  - \_
    "That's Sora, right?" I freaked out and thought she meant Vanitas. She meant Ventus.
  - \_
    She looks at Ven. "Is that Sora or Roxas?" Nope.
  - \_
    "Oh, three friends, like always!"
  - \_
    "When I heard the name Xehanort, I got really mad."
  - \_
    She INSTANTLY recognized Terra's armor as Lingering Will.
  - \_
    "Seriously? We're in Sleeping Beauty?" HUGE grin.
  - \_
    We fight the boss of Snow White. "He can't fight. He's a MASK."
  - \_
    "Wait. Vanitas is Ventus' darkness? That's why his heart was fixed with another."
  - That was a baby.
  - "Is the baby okay?"
  - The baby is fine.
  - \_
    Like Terra's armor, INSTANTLY RECOGNIZED KEYBLADE GRAVEYARD.
  - \_
    "It's Pete! Oh, Captain Dark? No, that's Pete."
  - \_
    Mom then came in and said we need to cosplay Kingdom Hearts. Sis decided we should be Organization members. She'll be Xion or the Organization Moogle.
  - \_
    "Why is Hercules young?"
  - \_
    "I missed Olympus!"
  - \_
    Sees Zack Fair. "It's the boy in the mask!"
  - Wrong boy in a mask. (She has sight problems)
  - \_
    "We're fighting Yellow Stitch!" (Never seen past the first Lilo and Stitch)
  - \_
    "Peter Pan is a good guy. We won't fight him. He can't be a boss."
  - \_
    "Wait, this is when they (Sora, Riku, Kairi) were little kids!"
  - \_
    MAD DASH TO COLLECT STICKERS
  - \_
    "I don't get why it's a graveyard."
  - I'll explain it later.
  - \_
    _beats Terranort, giant explosion_
    "Is everyone okay?"
  - _
    "Wait. It's over? But... I thought Terra would get his body back..."
    _
    VERDICT:
    It Was okay. Except the end.
  - **VENTUS**
    \_
    That master Xehanort guy seems cool, huh?
  - _eye roll from her_
  - \_
    "Wait, how did we get to Cinderella before Terra?"
  - \_
    Her: What was that?
    Ven: What was that?
    AND SO IT BEGINS
  - \_
    "Oh, wait. Vanitas is the darkness in Ven's heart. No wonder he can use the keyblade!"
  - \_
    "One problem I have is there's no teams. You're all alone fighting."
  - \_
    Lea shows up.
  - "You gotta be kidding me. Right?"
  - \_
    "Wait. Why didn't we play this game first, if it happens 10 years earlier? "
  - \_
    "Okay, do we get here before or after Terra?"
    This is a running theme.
  - \_
    She finally remembered Vanitas' name. At keyblade graveyard. She kept calling him the boy in the mask.
  - \_
    "Finally, he takes his mask off! ... Wait... Who is that?"
  - \_
    Vanitas dies. "Good riddance."
  - \_
    Ventus dies. "Bad ending."
    I cracked up.
  - \_
    VERDICT:
  - Little better than Terra's story. At least now I know Ventus didn't really die. He's just hiding in that baby.
  - **AQUA**
    \_
    What do you think Aqua's story will be like?
  - "Less Sad."
  - \_
    "Finally, we're a girl."
  - \_
    "Poor Aqua. Why is she bullied?"
  - \_
    We get ice cream after the minigame.
  - It's salty, but sweet.
  - "Haha, very funny, MidnightKoi."
  - \_
    "Ohhh, so that's how Pete met Maleficent."
  - \_
    She begs me to go to Deep Space before Olympus. She doesn't even know why. I think she just wanted to see Stitch.
  - \_
    Zach does his squats. "I like him."
  - He asks Aqua on a date. "I really like him. Does Aqua cone back for a date?"
  - \_
    We're getting ready to fight Braig. "You know what I've noticed? Everyone in the Organization has yellow eyes. Braig... Xehanort... Saix..."
  - _Holy shit, how did she notice?_
  - \_
    "Ohhh, everything makes sense now. Kinda." _reading reports_
  - \_
    Her only input on Final Chapter was cheering me on and saying how sad it is.
  - \_
    Secret Chapter: "That's a lot of darkness. Ohhh, THAT'S where Heartless came from!"
  - \_
    "Wait, who's the baby that Ven's heart went in? OF COURSE IT'S SORA."
  - \_
    VERDICT:
  - "Yeah, her story isn't less sad..."
  - \_
    Fave part: fighting in the coliseum, using magnet thunder thunder to win every round really fast.
  - \_
    Fave of the trio? Ventus. His story was the least sad.
  - \_
    Also, her two most common inputs:
  - "So, did we get here before or after [Insert Character]?"
  - "Don't worry! You beat this boss before! You can do it again! "
