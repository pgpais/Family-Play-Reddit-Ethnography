- Title
  - Something My Wife Said When She Beat Chapter 6
- Post
  - My wife and I are both huge fans of this game, but right when Red Dead 2 came out, she started grad school. I work a regular 9-5 job, so I didn't have many problems getting through the game in a timely manner, but my wife was playing the game really slowly, only finding time every couple days to do a mission.

  - Anyway, today I watched her beat Chapter 6, and something she said really struck me and honestly made me tear up. Right as Arthur died up on the rock, looking out over the valley as the sun rose, my wife just said one thing: "I'm so happy he didn't die in a city."

  - That wasn't even something I thought about when I beat Chapter 6, and it really struck me hard. I think I was so dizzy from the last hour of the chapter that I hadn't taken time to really think about Arthur's final moments.

  - Anyway, as I'm sure it's repeated here again and again, I cannot get over how amazing the story of this game is, and how great a character Arthur is. I had already seen the end of Chapter 6, but I was still just tearing up at the end. I love that Arthur is the type of character that both my wife and I can be completely invested in. Goddamn I love this game.

  - He was easy to get attached too and his death felt so real and had an actual impact on me, I felt empty when I started the epilogue playing with John and not Arthur with the gang.
