I got my dad into video games and after playing through quite a few in the last 5 years (god of war, uncharted, red dead) he thinks that the last of us 1 and 2 are masterpieces and are his new favourite games

He love the last of us games and we’ve had many discussions about them. When he finished the first one I was in another room and I could hear him yell noo as he killed the doctors and witnessed the final cutscene and I also heard him say “is that it”. He thought it was incredible and actually apologised to me saying he was sorry for doubting the impact that video games can have on storytelling.

So when I told him that the last of us 2 was coming out soon he was even more excited.
And after his 30 hour play through he was stunned. He said that he hadn’t had an experience like it before and was incredibly impressed at Both the dual narratives, how the MCs never acted how the player wanted, and was even more blown away by the ending. He would talk about it for days about how clever it was.

In conclusion the last of us 2 is my dads new favourite video game.
