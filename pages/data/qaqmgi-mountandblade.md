I got my mother into bannerlord lol

Post
So she is 48 her favorite show is Game of Thrones and when she saw me playing bannerlord against the Sturgians she asked what game it was. I pretty much told her everything and she was really interested because she wanted to play a game like GOT. She bought a whole ass laptop the next week and asked me to set everything up for it. I taught her steam, nexus, vortex, mods, everything. She plays for 3 hours every day after she gets back from work, she finally knows why I love playing games, she... understands everything. In her current playthrough, she has a few GOT unit and kingdom mods and she LOVES it. I never thought this would happen to her, especially since she used to be preaching against games and stuff but now she says it is fine and good for you (as long as you're not on for like 10 hours in one sitting, she says to get a life at that point but you know). I did this and Idk if I like it or love it.
