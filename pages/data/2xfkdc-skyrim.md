- Title
	- I let my dad play Skyrim
- Post
	- After reading the post /u/OjamaKnight made earlier, it reminded me of when I let my dad play skyrim.
	- This was a really long time ago, as in about 2 weeks after I got the game on 11/11/11. At the time I did not have a television in my room, so whenever I wanted to play the game I would have to play it in our living room, which is the only place my parents ever spend time, so they watched me play a lot of skyrim.

	- One day, when I was playing a thieve's guild only character, my dad noticed me stealing from a bunch of people's houses. He asked me why, and I told him I was a part of the thieves guild. He said that he wouldn't have made such a stupid decision to get involved in a group of thieves, so I offered him to play the game.

	- He started off, questioning why they would take a random passerby as a prisoner when he didn't do anything.

	- He ended up making a female Khajiit and named it Peaches, after our cat, who has since died. He thought that all the customization was pointless, so he just went with the default look.

	- He genuinely thought that the guards were going to kill him, and kept asking me what he did wrong, and when I said "your fine, just watch" he didn't believe me and kept pressing buttons to try and get out of it.

	- After the dragon swept in and interrupted, he kept talking about how nice the dragon was for saving his life and killing all the "soldier people". When I told him they were called imperials he shouted "those imperial bastards".

	- After climbing up the first tower, he freaked out as the dragon bursted through the wall. "What is wrong with that dragon!? First he comes down and tries to save me, then he tries to kill me. Is he bipolar or something?"

	- I then tell him he has to jump out the hole in the wall into the house. "What!? I have to jump down there!? This game! It's way to intense for me." Then he gave me the controller and took a nap.

	- After the nap he came up to me while I was playing and said "You know, I was a cat, I probably could have survived that jump."

	- **TL;DR** My dad made a khajiit and named it after my cat, befriended Alduin, then got too stressed out having to jump off the first tower, so he quit and took a nap.

	- > so he quit and took a nap.
	- Sounds like a cat alright.
