- Title
  - My dad started playing poker for me in red dead and I couldn’t be happier
- Post
  - I started playing rdr2 a few weeks ago for the first time. I quickly adapted to most features except for one…poker. I was never really good at poker so when I started trying to play it in Red Dead it was difficult to say the least. One day while playing poker in Red Dead my dad heard me tell my friend how I was having a difficult time playing poker and how I kept loosing. A little bit of backstory to my dad is that he loves poker and that he’s always been good at it. My dad has also participated in multiple tournaments for poker and has annual poker meet ups with all his friends. Anyways my dad offered to play for me and I accepted. At first he had some trouble with the controls but once I taught him it was win after win! I love my dad and to spend time with him and doing things that he enjoys too! It’s been amazing to play a game that both me and him like and I love learning the rules and the tricks of poker with him!

  - And dad, if by the off chance you see this, thank you for always being there and teaching be how to smartly play my hand

  - Patience is key. Especially in RDR2. The NPCs suck at poker. Dominoes too.
  - If your dad is good at poker, he's probably good at dominoes. Let him play those challenges too.
