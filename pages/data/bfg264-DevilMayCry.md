To my mom and aunt, thank you so much.

I played DMC5 since release and yesterday was the first time I played it at the living room ( im using pc). I played BP and not a minute has passed and my mom asked me ' Oh, are you playing Devil May Cry? ' and asked me what version is this. I said five and there was some short talk. 

I still remember to this day that when I first played dmc3 I never got past level 2 and the one who continued it was my mom. After that my aunt took over.  Lol. 

Mom don't plays games anymore tho.

Comment
What version of motivation is this?
