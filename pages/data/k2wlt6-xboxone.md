  - I am a huge gamer but don’t have many friends or any family who play games. My brother and I have a strained relationship but I have a fine relationship with his family and his 6 year old son, “Calvin”.
  - I found out from my sister-in-law, that Calvin loves video games but has only ever gotten to play at a friends house, and since they aren’t going places due to COVID-19, he hadnt been able to play games at all this year and Calvin was pretty sad about it.

  - They aren’t wealthy but could have been able to afford a game console, but didn’t ever do it since they don’t care about games.
  - I don’t have a Series S or X yet but I know that I want to get one next year. But I knew that it would make my nephew’s day/year if I gave him my Xbox and games.
  - The more I thought about it the more excited I became. I told my brother and SIL that I wanted to give it to Calvin as an early Christmas present. They thanked me and said yes, but I could tell they didn’t “get” it.
  - However, I didn’t really care what they thought, I just hoped Calvin would be interested. I definitely wasn’t expecting the absolute joy on his face when I gave it to him and the excitement I felt watching him play Lego Avengers surpassed almost any fun I’ve had playing a game.

  - I didn’t know my nephew very well before but now I feel like we have the beginnings of a real relationship. I told him he could FaceTime me if he needed help! My brother and SIL both seemed pleased about how happy it made Calvin too.

  - I don’t have any Xbox right now but It’s worth it!
  - If you read this far, thanks so much!
  - TL;DR - giving joy to others makes you also feel joy.
