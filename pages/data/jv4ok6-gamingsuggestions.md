	- Buying a Nintendo Switch for my daughters (8 & 10). What are the best games that we can all play as a family?
- Post
	- Don't tell my daughters, but they're getting a Nintendo Switch for Christmas! I'm happy with which console, joy-cons and accessories to get, but need a little help choosing the right games.
	- I'm really keen that this is a "family" games console and therefore I'm looking for two games for the Nintendo Switch that all 4 of us can all play together. As much as I want to get great single-player games like Zelda or Pokemon, I'm giving them a wide berth (for now) as I want to encourage playing as a family, and not having to deal with the girls squabbling over "turns".

	- At the moment my daughters have a Nintendo 3DS each and a tablet, and my older daughter has a laptop (allegedly for homework!). They like a range of games (favourites have been the Pokemon games and Stardew Valley) and we've enjoyed playing Mario Kart together on the Wii.

	- I've been a gamer my whole life and can pick up most games fairly quickly. My wife doesn't play games much at all, but is willing to give anything a go, as long as it's not too complicated, in the name of family fun.

	- Two-player games also appreciated, especially if they encourage co-operation.
	- Any pointers?

	- I can't advise Overcooked 1 & 2 enough. A lot of cooperative fun. Teaches to speak to and trust one another to overcome culinary difficulties in mad kitchens.
	- In March, Super Mario 3D World will be an absolute joy of 4 players platform game. Until then, if you like platforms, New Super Mario Bros U is fun as well.
	- Death Squared is a simple puzzle game for 2-4 players, your kids may have fun to work together to solve the levels.
	- Pokémon Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee can be played in two players. On the side effects, the game becomes way easier and the second player is "less important". If you manage to make them decide together which Pokémon to put into the party, they can play together in harmony. In any case, that's a game I think two young girls may like a lot, given the cute interactions with Pikachu/Eevee.
	  Pokémon Sword/Shield would force to take "turns".
	- It depends on the kind of daughters you have, but they may love Just Dance. It's also good for some sport.
	- Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is MK at its best. Can be enjoyed by casuals and pro racers for hundreds of hours.
	- Rayman Legends is one of the best platforms of all time, has 4 player coop, packs a lot of content and is now on huge discount.
	- If they like Stardew Valley, they probably would also like Animal Crossing. But watch out: 4 players can coexist in the same island, but there is only one island per console, and only the first player who boots up the game has the ability to make significant changes to the island layout. This may cause fights.
	- Since you're 4 people, you will most likely need a new set of joycons. Watch out, they drift easily as time passes. Also, since you say you're a gamer, if you plan to pick up some games for yourself the Pro Controller is a great option.
