  - She plays games as an escape, especially during Covid. Mass Effect was the last series she played, she adored it, but was furious at the lack of a clear happy ending.
  - ... She is romancing Solas.
- Comment
  - The next thing you tell us is that she is playing DAO as non-Cousland who makes unhardened Alistair a King and then refuses to do the Dark Ritual, but brings Alistair at the final battle
  - Or you know, just romancing Anders in DA2
