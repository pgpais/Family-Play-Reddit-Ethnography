	- My wife and I lost our daughter a few months ago. During this troubling time due to world events and our own circumstances I got my wife to play video games. They have always been a great outlet for me and I hoped they would help her as well.

	- We discovered she likes RPGs in particular both JRPGs and WRPGs, she has yet to try Strategy RPGs, being intimidated by their genre name. Her first one was FFIX the upbeat nature of the game and it's penchant for comedic moments was a godsend for us. She followed that up with FFVIII, Star Wars:Knights of the Old Republic(light side playthrough), and Alpha Protocol(no executions). She wanted to move on and try Mass Effect knowing their was possible permanent party member death. As we sat down to play an hour into the game she received word from one of her best friends that they had also lost their child shortly after birth. We are now mourning for our own loss as well as for our friends. My wife's heart has been torn asunder all over again.

	- So, please help my wife and I find some good games to begin healing all over again! An upbeat rpg, Japanese or Western or Strategy are fine, no overt death of children, and a strong preference towards no permanent party character death. We own a PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4, and an XBOX 360.

	- We're about to start Dragon Quest VIII on ps2. I bought it years ago and never really played it, but it looks like a very safe game to play. If I'm wrong about this one please let me know! Thanks in advance.

	- Firstly, I’m sorry for your loss, and I hope both you and your wife can work through it together
	- Secondly, Stardew Valley is famous for being a ‘feel good’ kinda game. You can play co-op together, start a farm in a nice small town.
	  It’s extremely upbeat and relaxing, however your character can ‘die’ if you lose all of your health. I put quotations because you’re not really dying, more so just respawning back at your farm.

	- I really can’t stress enough just how peaceful and relaxing stardew valley is. It’s not for everyone, of course, but I highly suggest you give it a try. It’s fairly cheap, available on a variety of platforms, and has a great community and developer
