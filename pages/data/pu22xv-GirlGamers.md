	- I am so tired of being “accused” of only liking videogames because my husband likes them.
	- My dad took me to the arcade as soon as I could stand up (he said he had a pic of him holding me as a toddler up to play on the games. I’m gonna ask about it). So no. I like them because my DAD liked them and taught me how fun they are.

	- But don’t get me wrong. I’m still trash at videogames. Other than Mortal Kombat. My dad and I’s fave. I’m getting a tattoo lmao
	- What do you guys say to this? I normally am like, “yeah. Its crazy. The second my husband slid the ring on my finger I discovered a love of videogame.” Very monotonously.

	- I think they are just trying trivialize the fact you love gaming.  Maybe to deal with their own insecurities? I dunno. It's lame.
	- If a guy gave me that attitude, I'd tell them I was a gamer before puberty when I didn't like boys.  Wonder what stupid idea they would come up with after that. I was 8 in 1989 when I started gaming.  1994 when I got into FPS (original Doom series).  And likely that guys saying this were not even a glimmer in their dads eye when I was gaming.
