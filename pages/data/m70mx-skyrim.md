- Title
	- Oblivion and my grandfather.
- Post
	- I think it was summer 2006, I was a travel nurse living and working in San Diego.  My grandfather got a terminal cancer diagnosis.  Our family is originally from north Alabama so I took a travel assignment in the closest spot I could find, Little Rock, AR.  So for four months I worked my shifts in the PICU there and traveled back and forth spending what time I could with my grandfather.  He raised 4 daughters.  I was the first grandchild and first "son".  He and I were each other's favorite human beings my entire life.  He was an old school southern badass.  He looked like Clint Eastwood in the movies with Clyde.  I have that movie poster in the man cave now.
	- Toward the end of his run with cancer I spent as much time as I could with him...that usually meant spending the night in the hospital with him.  I bought this sweet travel bag for my 360 and had this Samsung flat panel monitor with a tv tuner (Synchmaster 150, I remember paying like 700 bucks for that thing...times have changed).   In the evenings he and I would watch old Charles Bronson westerns, Ken Burns baseball, and he'd sit and watch me cruise around Oblivion.  You can't really sleep in those shitty fold out hospital chairs and the nurse in me was a little bit of a hyper vigilant asshole when it came to my grandfather's care...so I sat overwatch.  I remember how amazed he was that a game was that open and cool.

	- I'm sure he'd have been just as intrigued with pretty much anything I played.  I think Red Dead Redemption would have brought tears to his eyes.  (Also the GPS in my truck blew his fucking mind.)  I remember sitting up all night keeping an eye on him, headphones on, wandering around Tamriel.  Those were a few of the best days of my life and my fondest memories with my grandfather.
	- I can't wait to get lost in Skyrim this weekend.  Time has moved on and I'm a bit more grown up with a son of my own.  I can't wait till the little guy grows up and I can share how great a gaming experience can be...especially one like TES.  His mother isn't much of a gamer, but he'll take after his daddy.

	- Anyway, I just wanted to share a quick story with you guys about how near and dear Oblivion is to my heart.  I've played through several times.  I have a passion for quite a few games, but nothing else has come close to Morrowind or Oblivion for me.  (Fallout 3 was awesome, New Vegas was a letdown for some reason...I couldn't finish it.  Arkham City is cool, but is getting shelved for a long time.  Skrim will own me, and I'll play through the Metal Gear HD remix for a break...how absolutely awesome is this November?)
	- Don't ever let anyone tell you gaming isn't as important or valuable as any other experience you have.  While I have many sunny Saturdays hanging out and watching Alabama football with my grandfather, one of the days I cherish the most we spent going through the Dark Brotherhood line...that was the coolest.

	- This is our weekend, fellow gamers.  I hope you all have just as much fun as I do.  Friday can't come quick enough.
	- Edit:  Thanks for all the kindness everyone.  Come to think of it, my dad has recently started gaming and was telling me how much he liked Fable 3.  Guess what he's getting in the mail from Amazon...heh...he thinks the Fable universe is awesome...dragons and all that other ill ass shit in Skyrim is going to floor him.
