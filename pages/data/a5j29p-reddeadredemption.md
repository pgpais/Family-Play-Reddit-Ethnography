- Title
  - I let my dad try out this game...
- Post
  - My parents came up for a visit this past weekend. I was so excited to show my dad this game, mainly because you can fish in the game and my dad is a huge fisherman. Like anything to do with fishing, he's all over it.

  - I took Arthur over to a dock, cast my line out and handed the controller to my dad. I told him how to control the fish and reel it in, and he grasped it within seconds. Before I knew it, he was wrestling a huge sturgeon.

  - After about 5 minutes of him struggling to bring this monster fish in, an NPC in a canoe casually rows in from the left side of the screen, heading straight for my dad's fishing line. The canoe hit the line and snapped it. My dad was shocked, and I nearly died laughing.

  - Thanks RDR2 for making a game great for all ages and for allowing me to play with my dad. It was a special moment and very funny. He wants to play more in the future!

  - If you didn't teach your dad how to lasso or shoot the guy in the canoe, you're cheating him.
