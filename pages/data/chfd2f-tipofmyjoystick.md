- Title
  - Non-existent GBA game my uncle showed me, Resident Evil but not???
- Post
  - I've made edits to this post to rule out games that I looked at and don't match, as well as some definite elements of the game I remember.
  - So as a kid my uncle lodged with us for a while and he had a PS2 and a GBA, as well as several PCs. He was very techy guy back then. Anyway, when he was playing I got interested and he showed me Metroid Fusion and this other resident evil-like game. I am absolutely certain it was on the GBA (sp if that matters)

  - I only remember one scene; the camera was angled like an isometric tile type game and the character movement was the same. There were two characters, literally ones I've seen in resident evil. The male had a pistol and the female had an smg or a shotgun, either way a bigger gun. You could switch between the two and they were standing in this yellow hallway with dark flooring. I am sure that there was zombie killing involved.
  - Note that I've never played Resident Evil, only seen clips of it but I'm aware that it's an old franchise. I've tried searching for a RE game on GBA and all that comes up is the RE2 tech demo, which I tried and found to not be the game I'm looking for.
  - EDIT/UPDATE: So far, nothing. These are the games I've ruled out and why:
  - Alone In the Dark: This is not the game. There seems to be only one main character upon quick glance and the graphics are too different. They seem very artistic and "painting"-like and the game I'm remembering was more basic. Very similar to environments in Max Payne in terms of detailing.
  - Jurassic Park 3: The character style is similar, but the game itself bears almost no resemblance to what I had in mind.
  - RE Gaiden: Graphics style is very different. More top down than what I had in mind. Again, refer to Max Payne.
  - RE Tech Demo for GBA: Also not it. Graphics were actually more advanced than in my head, and didn't feature the scene I remembered.
  - Boktai: Very cartoony graphics and I don't see multiple characters. Gameplay looks very different.
  - In general, the character design is supposed to be...skeletony? Think again to Max Payne, or otherwise the Tony Hawk games on GBA. Same with the angled camera and level of detail.
  - EDIT 2: I still haven't settled on a game. This is getting to be more drawn out that I thought, and I'm sorry if I'm wasting your time everyone. Here are some more games I've ruled out:
  - MediEvil: Not at all related to my memory
  - Broken Sword: Pretty game, but not familiar at all. Environments are open and it's an RPG it appears. Looks fun though, I might play it
  - Ghost Trap: The main character doesn't match, and there's a menu on the side of the screen that looks unfamiliar. Gameplay also doesn't match.
  - PS2 Games: 100% sure this was on the GBA guys. My memory of the original game lines up with the GBA's graphics.
  - Rebelstar Tactical Command: Premise of the game doesn't match, and the graphics are much too cartoony.
  - 007 Everything or Nothing: Gameplay does not match, neither does the main character.
  - Van Helsing: Camera angle is totally off, as well as main character again.
  - Scurge Hive: I've played this one before, it's not it.
  - Terminator 3: Main characters and environment s again.
  - Ecks Vs Sever: This is an FPS, not the one I played.
  - Metal Gear Solid GBC: Top down camera and graphics don't match.
  - A Sound of Thunder: Graphics are similar, but the environments don't ring a bell at all and are a bit too detailed for what I remember. Gameplay and characters also don't match, and there was no multiplayer link-cable gaming involved in my memory.
  - After really analyzing my memory to the best of my ability, here's what I absolutely do remember:
  - I played this game sometime between 2007-2010 but I'm sure the game itself is older.
  - It was played on GBA.
  - Isometric style camera and diagonal movement
  - Two characters, male having a pistol and female with an SMG or shotgun. I'm leaning towards SMG.
  - They were standing in a yellow hallway with dark floors. Maybe a dark red or brown.
  - They were both in a similar uniform.
  - There was shooting of monsters/zombies/mutants involved.
  - I've looked at several possible RE titles and something that always makes a lightbulb go off in my head is when I see the mansion. I'm not sure how to refer to it in the franchise but those yellow walls and dark floors are exactly the ones I remember, just not at the same angle. I am sure this game is somehow related to RE, whether it be a bootleg or a spinoff or something.
  - Final Edit: Solved guys.
  - I texted my uncle with no expectation he would remember what I was talking about, and it turns out that he did have a DS with RE Deadly Silence on it.
  - I'm clueless as to why I don't remember a DS, but now I know why I got goosebumps when watching video of the DS game on youtube. Thank you everyone so much for your help and I apologize for such a stupid ending to this mystery.
- Comment
  - There was a Resident Evil game on Gameboy Color. The GBA(SP) was backward compatible and could play GBC games.
