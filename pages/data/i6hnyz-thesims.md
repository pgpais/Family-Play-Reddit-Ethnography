  - So when I was around 13 I got the sims and I loved it. It was great for a few months, than my dad found out that you can woohoo with the sims. He immediately deleted the whole game and forbid me from playing. I grew up in an ultra catholic family so i guess that's why. Even though I only woohooed with the sims after marriage and only for procreation(i know, i know but catholic guilt extended to the sims). Now i'm 20 and i play the sims and woohoo with them whenever i like, so jokes on you, dad
