	- Hi guys, I'm trying to play more games with my wife and build up her confidence towards more challenging games. I really want to play games like Divinity and Diablo with her eventually but she's SO not ready haha.

	- She's also got loads of time to kill in quarantine so I want to find her something she can play without me, and something we can do together. I tend to play heavy depth story intense games so my experience with her style of game is way limited.

	- She's gotten super into animal crossing but has played it to death and the gameplay is kind of shallow, even for her. We've started playing Stardew together, but I have played a lot of it before and she feels like she's really behind because I know everything...
	  I want to try and progress to more involved adventure or RPG games etc in such a way she doesn't get overwhelmed. I was thinking maybe Terraria/Starbound or Portal 2 would be a good next step but to play co-op but am keen for other suggestions. She really likes goal-oriented gameplay and things with characters and a light tone. We have a switch, 2 capable PCs and Xbone.

	- Thanks folks. Sorry for the cliche post I know these come up all the time haha!
	- Edit: Thanks for all the amazing suggestions everyone, this got waaaay more response than I expected. Much appreciated!

	- Minecraft is great for newer gamers. Also, side note, Minecraft dungeons just came out recently and it is basically a much simpler Diablo 3 set in the Minecraft universe. It could be a good way to get her used to that kind of gameplay.
