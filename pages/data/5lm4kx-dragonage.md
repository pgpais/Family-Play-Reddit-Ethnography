  - So my husband has been playing DA:I lately on the XBox One, since we picked up the GOTY edition for pretty cheap in a sale about a month back. He is aware that I'm a little obsessed with Cullen (I have Cullen on my computer desktop, it's hard to miss), and I've told him he looks like Blackwall (big and beardy, oh, yeah), but other than a couple of things here and there, he's largely unspoiled, surprisingly.

  - So I was watching him play as I occasionally do, and he listened to the horrible story Blackwall tells about the dog (I always skip through that, ugh, horrible story), then I said, "Go talk to Blackwall in the stables". No Blackwall. Scout gives him a note about a war criminal. "Okay," says my husband. "He went to Val Royaux to get this guy?" I said nothing other than "Go to Val Royeaux. Take Varric with you."

  - So the big scene comes up, the crowd is there, Blackwall marches up onto the platform and starts to talk... husband works out what's going on and goes. "Oh, shit." Cut to Varric, who just worked out what's going on and who goes, "Oh, shit." Cut to me, giggling like mad.

  - Can't wait to see what he has to say about Solas...
