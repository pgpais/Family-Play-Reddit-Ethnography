	- My husband used to play super mario brothers on our original nintendo while I was cooking, and I want to hear the music again. I feel like getting good at this game will give me something fun to focus on in my grief, as well.

	- I'm so sorry for your loss. Video games would be a great distraction, bring some childhood wonder into your life. Real advice is to just pick it up and enjoy. Hold B while walking to run, and for shortcuts, check for walkthroughs on gamefaqs.com. Wishing you the best in this hard time.
