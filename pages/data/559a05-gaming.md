My husband died and I want to get really good at super mario brothers so I can hear all the music again

Post
My husband used to play super mario brothers on our original nintendo while I was cooking, and I want to hear the music again. I feel like getting good at this game will give me something fun to focus on in my grief, as well.

Are there any good tutorials on the internet for this game? Cheat codes? Does anyone have any tips? 

Thanks, everybody.

I'm so sorry for your loss. Video games would be a great distraction, bring some childhood wonder into your life. Real advice is to just pick it up and enjoy. Hold B while walking to run, and for shortcuts, check for walkthroughs on gamefaqs.com. Wishing you the best in this hard time.
