  - Hi all,
  - My wife bought a gaming PC and we’d obviously like to find some games to play together.

  - She’s NOT into shooters/survivalist (COD, Battlefield, PUBG, Valorant etc).

  - She IS into:

    -MMORPG (Warcraft, Guild Wars)

    -Relaxing games (Stardew Valley, My time at Portia)

    -CO-OP / adventure AAA titles (Diablo 3, Horizon Zero Dawn)

  - Some games we had on our list:
    -Lovers in a dangerous spacetime (not overly excited for it. Looks like a good time killer though)
    -Don’t starve together
    -A way out
    -It takes two
  - Anything else you might add?
  - Thanks!

  - A Way Out and It Takes Two are quintessential games for you and your SO. Portal 2 is also a good choice. My wife and I loved it.
