WSIB: Wife bought a gaming PC and we would like to play games together

Post
Hi all,

My wife bought a gaming PC and we’d obviously like to find some games to play together. 

She’s NOT into shooters/survivalist (COD, Battlefield, PUBG, Valorant etc). 

She IS into: 

-MMORPG (Warcraft, Guild Wars)

-Relaxing games (Stardew Valley, My time at Portia)

-CO-OP / adventure AAA titles (Diablo 3, Horizon Zero Dawn)

Some games we had on our list:
-Lovers in a dangerous spacetime (not overly excited for it. Looks like a good time killer though)
-Don’t starve together
-A way out
-It takes two 

Anything else you might add?

Thanks!

A Way Out and It Takes Two are quintessential games for you and your SO. Portal 2 is also a good choice. My wife and I loved it.
