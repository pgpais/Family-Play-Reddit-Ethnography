  - My dad and I are big western fans, but him being 71 years old he doesn't really play video games all that much (aside from solitaire and scrabble on his phone haha). He's tried to play console games before and he just doesn't understand the controller and has a hard time remembering what all the buttons do.

  - I had a feeling he'd really love RDR2, so I've been bringing my PS4 over to my parent's house every other weekend or so and he watches me play. Anytime a moral decision, stranger mission, random event, or an NPC that needs help comes up, I let him decide what to do. I also let him decide all on all the customization options.

  - We're at the Saint Denis chapter right now and he's really enjoying the story so far. He loves the dialogue and busts out laughing anytime Arthur displays his sardonic wit. We've had some good conversations about the story, the characters, their motivations, and he's even theorized on how some plot points will turn out.

  - Anyway, I know this sub is mostly memes and online bashing, I just thought I'd share my little experience with the game.
