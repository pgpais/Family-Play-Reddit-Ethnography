	- Kingdom Hearts and my sister.
- Post
	- Growing up my sister and I fell in love with these games. I remember watching my sister, who was 10 years older than me, play the first KH1 nonstop (I was around 4-5 years old when the first game came out). I was too young to understand how to play the game but that never stopped me from watching her freak out about fighting riku. Jump to 2007, when my sister and I had KH2 given to us for Christmas. I remember playing it nonstop with her in the living room for hours on end. The game had become not only a big part of our childhood but also our lives. We always randomly brought up quotes and things we loved about the game (especially the soundtrack). Flash forward to today and my sister passed away 8 months ago due to a drug overdose. I haven’t had the courage to play the games since she has passed because of what it meant to her and I and the bond we built through the game.Today I decided to start up KH1 (our favorite one) and am just sitting on the Home Screen listening to the intro music crying. I miss her everyday but somehow feel closer to her as I sit here listening to the theme music. I’m not Sure when if ever I will get the courage to play the games again but I am forever grateful for the everlasting memories this game has created for me and for allowing for me to feel close to my sister again for the first time since she passed. Thank you Kingdom Hearts ❤️

	- The exact same thing with me but with my older brother. He bought KH1for me before he was deployed to iraq and never came home. I miss him everyday. Playing the game for me was very therapeutic. As hard as it may be i highly recommend playing through it.
