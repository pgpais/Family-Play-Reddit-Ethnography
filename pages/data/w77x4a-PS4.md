  - I'm going off to college this year. Should I leave my PS4+videogames at home for my little brother to play (he's 8 yo)

  - I'm gonna be away for (mostly) 5 years, and I have all my PS2/DS/PSP/PS4 games at my mom's (parents are divorced). I'm thinking of leaving the ps4 at my dad's house so my lil bro can get into some modern classics. The MF only cares about football and shitty youtubers' content. He and his friends nowadays don't even watch cartoons! They only care about the trendy ass games and watching shit on their tablets. He never had a console but always liked watching me play games, either on pc or console (I sometimes put him on areas where I'm overlevel'd so he can try out the games, and even installed minecraft/brawlhalla/league ðŸ’€on my dad's shitty laptop). I want to show him true videogaming, here's the list of my ps4's:
    tags:: [[Kinship/Sibling]], [[Affected by Family/Facilitating others' play]], [[Shared Experiences/Spectating]]
  - Uncharted ( all of them; probably a good starter); Last of Us; Dark Souls; Bloodborne (they're tough as nails but he likes them xd); Shadow of the Colossus; Horizon Zero Dawn; Mirror's Edge Catalyst; GTA V; Ghost Recon Wildlands; Ghost of Tsushima; God of War III and IV; Assassin's Creed IV; AC Origins; Red Dead Redemption 2; Resident Evil 7 (ðŸ’€); DOOM)
  - (Also got a lot of good shit on the PSP/PS2/DS)
