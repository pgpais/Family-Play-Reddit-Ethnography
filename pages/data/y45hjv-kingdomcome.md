- Post
	- My wife is concerned about letting our son try this game due to the nudity. I haven't seen any of it yet, so I'm wondering how graphic it is, and where about in the game it happens so I can figure out if it something I can have him avoid or if we should just make him wait on playing.

	- He's been watching me play for a week or so now and even after me telling him I think it would be too difficult for him, he still wants to give it a go.

	- If you can get your kid immersed and enjoying this game, he stands to learn alot about medieval life.

	- As a history graduate this game is a almost a 10/10. Sometimes it feels like I'm walking around a reenactment village.
	- There are no claw hammers to be found in the blacksmiths and there are no circular saws at the charcoal encampments.
