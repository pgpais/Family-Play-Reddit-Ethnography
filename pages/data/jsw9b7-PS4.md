- Title
	- Step son called me dad for the first time and gave his ps4
- Post
	- Haven't played my ps4 in a bit, but a friend gave me a copy of watch dogs legion so I wanted to check it out. The system is pooped. Cant get it to do anything. Did some troubleshooting, did some google, nothing worked and have to get a new one.
	- Step son walked in and asked, what's up dad, i told him the issue, he goes into his room and after a couple of minutes walked out with his ps4 and said take mine.
	- Was floored. First time he ever did that. We have been playing games together on ps4 for years, or helping eachother with games like God of War, but I never realized how much it made us bond.
