	- What SIB that my mom would enjoy playing?
- Post
	- Hello all,
	- I’m looking for a game I think my mom would enjoy, as video games has never really peeked her interest until about a year ago. She started playing Fortnite with me. A weird video game to start off on, I will admit, but she loved it. She loved the challanges, wacky skins and dances, everything, including playing it with me (she’ll usually play until she gets frustrated, then just hands me the controller and goes “kill people” and watches me play). She’s got so invested hat she has bought every battlepass since Season 7. Now I want to see what other games she might like, or be willing to play. A couple things that may help:

	- •While she’s gotten better at the games, she still mixes up buttons and gets confused every now and then, especially in highly stressful situations.
	- •She loves every other medium, from reading to movies and tv shows, and especially loves good stories.
	- That’s it. I’d also be happy to answer any questions that may help. Other than that... any suggestions?
	- TL;DR: good games for someone not used to video games and likes a good story?

	- Portal would be my recommendation. Stardew Valley is also an idea
