Title
I lost my mother recently and parts of this game resonates even more now

Post
I binged Devil May Cry 5 on PC the weekend it was released. I hadn't had that much fun in a single player game in years and I enjoyed almost every second of it.

One thing I found striking was the >!scene with Eva!<. It stuck with me long after finishing the game. Then I remembered Vergil's motivation for gaining power throughout the series - knowing your mother died because you were helpless is a terrible thing to feel, and (I assume) he didn't want that to happen again. He wanted power to protect, he didn't want to be in that situation again.

Last Friday my mother died. She retired from teaching in January and had only just recovered from her hip replacement surgery. The day before was the first time she walked without her crutches and both her and my dad were ecstatic. Doctors were happy with test results too because they found no issues. My parents had lots of plans on how to spend their remaining years. I was happy. But on Friday morning she passed on due to what we assume to be an pulmonary embolism, and all we could do was try and keep her comfortable while the ambulance made their way to us. Unfortunately, they arrived too late. My dad and I watched her pass on and I was POWERLESS. I couldn't do anything to save her. It broke me. 

I had plans on finishing every difficulty in the game to prepare myself for Bloody Palace but right now I don't feel like doing anything at all. I'm a miserable wreck and I'm trying to be strong for my dad, whose taking it even worse than I am. The reel of what happened keeps playing in my head, and thoughts about how the Sons of Sparda probably felt as they grew up linger in my mind from time to time.

Does Dante behave that way as a coping mechanism? Is everything that Vergil does justified because of how he feels when he couldn't protect his mother? 

I'm lost right now. How do I cope with this? 

I'm sorry for posting something like this in such a positive sub, but I needed to vent, and I only have my fellow DMC Redditors to listen to my thoughts on the parallels I drew between the game and my life.

Thanks for listening.

Hope you recover from this man. Thanks for sharing.

But regards to Dante, it is unclear if his behavior stems from his childhood trauma, although it is probably implied. If anything, he learned to stay human as opposed to Vergil, whom only thought to not lose anything again, you must be strong.
