Title
My husband played a female character in a game

Post
My husband wanted to teach our oldest son how to play WoW tonight. He played a female character and some dude just followed them around for a long time, just being obnoxious and kept harassing my husband thinking he was a girl until he finally said “dude, I’m a dude”. They decided to just quit playing WoW for now and switched to a different game. They both mentioned how uncomfortable it made them feel so we had a good discussion about online behavior (really just being a decent person). I’ve been pretty fortunate with my online gaming experiences but I know the harassment is really prevalent out there. I promise I’m doing my best as a mom and a gamer to teach my sons empathy and how to treat people respectfully online and irl. Here’s to hoping the next generation of gamers have more kindness and self control!

As garbage as the experience was, it’s good that it lead to a positive discussion about treating people well online. Sorry to hear about the experience though!
