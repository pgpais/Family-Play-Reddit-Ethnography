- Title
  - My wife got me a Xbox One S for Xmas. She's not a gamer of any sort. What's a game that we might be able to play together?

  - She has never really played video games and has little interest in them, mostly thinking of them as first-person shooters and the like. We have been married long enough that I know my primary chance to play will be when I can convince her or my son to play with me. Also, I haven't really played in about 10 years. Any ideas?

  - Lovers in a dangerous space time: This is a 2D couch coop where you pilot and defend a spaceship. It's cute.
  - Castle crashers: Another 2D couch coop. This is a side scrolling hack and slash rpg. It's fun to play and has a good sense of progression and challenge.
  - Zombie Vikings: Another 2D side scrolling hacker. I just bought this myself and it feels a lot like castle crasher but with hints of norse mythology.
  - Minecraft: This your son or even you might like. It's essentially virtual legos. You start off in a world and can mine, build, and craft anything you can imagine.
