Title
Some of my first memories are watching my older brother play Kingdom Hearts 1. He passed away 2 years ago and I just finished Kingdom Hearts 3

Like the title says, I was only 3 when he got Kingdom Hearts 1. We played through 1, Chain of Memories, 2, and days together before playing the others on our own. I remember when he beat sephiroth in KH2 and us running around the basement. Over the last year I played through all of them again and finished KH3 about 30 minutes ago.

Tears were shed, he wouldâ€™ve loved the game.

Man
You were 3 when you became a fan and just finished 3.
