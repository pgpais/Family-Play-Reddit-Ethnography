Christmas Present for my Mother

Post
My mother is 50 years old and on her chrsitmas list put “video game we can all play as a family”. There are 4 people in my family and we have a Wii, Wii U, switch, and PS4. Normally this would be an easy task, but my parents are not tech savvy at all even when it comes to video games so they would only be able to play the simplest of games. For example, years ago when I tried to teach them Super Smash Bros Brawl, they could not understand/learn it no matter how hard they tried but they had a lot of fun with New Super Mario Bros Wii and understood it. It would be great if anyone could recommend a game that is easy to learn and is fun for four players
