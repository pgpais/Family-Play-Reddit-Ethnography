  - Red Dad Redemption Saga pt.1

  - Hi all! A lot of you might see the name of the post and know what this is(I got the name from one of your comments). If not, this is a response to the many, _many_, people asking for updates from this post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/rk80v8/my_dad_is_playing_rdr_2_and_hes_attached_to_his/).
  - First of all, I stayed up way later than I should have to rattle my brain and make notes on the things he's told me about his journey so far in the game. So the first part of the saga might be short. Also, again, my father is in his 70s and up until very recently was very much against technology, so updates will be slow, as he's not great at the game.

  - Now I want to address some common things that were asked a lot before I get into what you are all here for:
  - **Possibly streaming this or recording:** I talked to the big man this morning and told him he was popular on here right now and you all wanted to join in on the journey with him...he got real quiet. While he doesn't mind me sharing his adventures, the truth is outside the immediate family, he doesn't talk much. Hell, it wasn't until this game that he opened up really to us. When I would call home he barely spoke to me before handing the phone off to my mom.

  - So the idea of being recorded and people watching him live makes him uneasy. Plus, while he didn't outright say it, I think he is worried about strangers seeing him play because will be a lot of him running into things and reloading the game. So as of right now, I don't think it's in the cards.
  - **His opinion of John:** He's hurt John left his family(Abigail and Jack) and is as upset as Arthur. However, my noted Arthur said, "Leaving the kid is one thing, but abandoning the gang?" or something like that. It bothered him and he told me that felt really out of place >!(he doesn't know about Eliza or Isaac yet)!<

  - **His opinion on Micah:** From the moment they found Sadie, my dad has ranted he doesn't understand his place in the gang. He said along the lines of "We have good guns already. This is the guy that gets a squad killed."

  - Okay now for memorable things my dad has said while playing RDR 2(not in any real order):
  - "We reached a mining town. The Blackwater job went real bad, I don't think Hosea and Arthur wanted the job. They weren't involved. Should have listened to Hosea, he's the oldest in this profession."
  - He's talking about one of the gang members being super prepared for the climate and I realize he's talking about Charles: "This is like winters in Wisconsin, and this man is the only one prepared! Cover your ears people!." (goes on to tell me about how he got frostbite one winter on his feet, which I knew because he can't wear certain kinds of socks)

  - "The more I hear about Blackwater the more I'm concerned. This doesn't sit right with me, not at all. I've seen things go bad in the war quickly. Sometimes for no reason, but there always is. Sometimes you really did just walk into a trap. this smells like a trap."

  - "We saved John! It was rough, and wolves are no joke. Mostly if food is hard for them in harsh months. We lost livestock to them as well as the cold."
  - "Hey Pearson was a sailor! We have something in common!" (He was a Seal, not quite the same but I let it go)

  - "Hosea and Dutch are fighting, I have to agree with Hosea, and I think Arthur does too, I read his journal, man is a thinker and a man of action. But he doesn't say anything. Come on Arthur, you need to speak up."
  - "We need to make sure Jack survives. He's just a boy and harsh climates like this are dangerous if not prepared."
  - "We saved a woman today. Sadie is her name. Poor woman, no one deserves that. I will make sure she is taken care of and killed all those bastards."
  - "We captured an O'Driscoll, he's a nervous sort, could be an act."
  - "Charles taught Arthur and I how to hunt. Good man, a man of the land I like him."
  - "This man called some of the men in the gang slurs. You don't talk about your brother in arms like that! Talk to me like that and I'll let the bullet hit you."
  - “Oh, Hosea is clearly my father. I like him. Listen to the men who found old age in a profession where men die young.”

  - “I’m glad Arthur cares about his horse.”
  - “Shoot, I didn’t realize Arthur could lose weight! Your sister was teasing me about how thin he was. I made him some nice venison. I think he deserves it.”
    tags:: [[Kinship/Parent]] [[Kinship/Sibling]] [[Shared Experiences/Discussing Aspects of game]]
  - “I love John, but he needs to realize he has a family now.”
  - “I saw some wild turkey today. Got one, didn’t want to get greedy had a nice buck strapped to Henry.”
  - “I went hunting with dad for a large bear. We found the bear, but it almost got Hosea! I was scared shitless! Reminds me of when I went boar hunting with Mikey(name changed for obvious reasons) (His long-dead older brother)” (Tells hunting story)

  - “The girls in camp are real nice. I hope everyone treats them well.”
  - “I bought some new clothes today. I look real sharp, and gave Arthur a little shave he deserved it.”
  - **Things my sibling has heard him saying to the monitor:**
  - "Sorry, Son. These old hands were never quick"
  - "There are coyotes nearby, I hope they aren't desperate."
  - "Arthur, defend Hosea more!"
  - "Don't panic Arthur we got this."
  - "It's like life. Look at these trees. The sounds! It takes me back home."

  - **Okay everyone that's all I can remember for now. I promise another update and will start jotting things down now when he calls to tell me about his adventures.**

  - This makes me smile. Very wholesome.
