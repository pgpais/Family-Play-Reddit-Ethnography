	- I never thought I'd need to enable some form of Parental Controls on Steam. Thanks for horrifying my Mother.

	- I managed to get my elderly mother into PC gaming at Christmas. I say PC gaming but she's mostly into puzzle /adventure games or the occasional platformer but we purchased her a laptop that could yield a decent gaming experience. I got her hooked on Steam with Ori and she's completely addicted to Farming Simulator. She's a very conservative, church going person and at times can be a bit naive but she's tolerant to most things. Even the games that you could have a soft-core JAV argument just gets an eye roll reaction.

	- One of the things I got her for Mother's Day was a $50 Wallet card. I told her to save it for the sale and yesterday I showed her how to redeem as well as browse Steam. I thought at the least she might find a recommended title from her queue or just grab a DLC for Farm Sim.

	- Earlier I got a call from her to come remove this "Damn" Steam from her computer and immediately knew something was up since that was probably the 10th time in my 40 years that I heard her use the word. She had left it open as she had found it so I could see and there in all it's glory was the first game in her queue: Genital Jousting.

	- It never occurred to me that I'd need to set a content filter because like I said she's fairly tolerant. However a cartoon cock-n-balls in the middle of her screen was a bit too much for her to handle.

	- I'm trying to imagine her main carousel to maximize her traumatization
		- Genial Jousting
		- What's under your blanket
		- Shower with Dad Simulator (/u/realmenlovecats01)
		- Mount Your Friends (/u/Strog21)
		- Radiator 2 (/u/Blodoffer)
	- Feel free to add to the "Steam Carousel of Parental Trauma"
	- On a more serious note since most digital games do not require certification/classification any parental controls would be moot since there's no way to flag a lot of games on Steam to filter based on that.
