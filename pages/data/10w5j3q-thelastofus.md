- Title
  - It feels so surreal having my family get into the story of TLOU after having been a fan for 10 years.
- Post
  - I recently went to visit some family and asked if any of them were watching the show. No one had, so I decided to show them the first episode. My nephew-in-law had to chime in and say “they ruined it” cause of episode 3 (we all know why). That little hiccup aside, we began. My mom, a healthcare worker, was immediately fascinated by the fungal infection. Never liked any kind of zombie media, but she was so intrigued by it. No one in my family was prepared for Sarah’s death, as expected. Then, when they met Ellie, everyone loved her immediately. I know some people don’t care for Bella Ramsey, but to a new viewer, she is winning hearts over easily.
  - I had to leave after the first episode. Few hours later, I get a text from my (very slightly homophobic) mom that just read “We finished episode 3. I love Bill and Frank”, then they proceeded to watch EP 4 that night. They could not get enough. The only times my mom binges tv is when she gets behind on Days of Our Lives. Next day I get a text from my sister who’s never played a video game in her life saying “I wish I could play the games now”. It’s just so surreal to see this property I’ve adored for basically a decade find such a new audience. Hats off to HBO/Mazin/Druckmann and everyone else involved, it’s amazing.

  - These are the same kinds of people that probably in the past view video games as kids stuff. They never realize it is just a different medium. We (that have played games since we’re young) always knew that games are just another way to enjoy our time.
  - I’m happy that your family and friends are starting to realize how beautiful this story is. I too have friends that are enjoying the new show!
