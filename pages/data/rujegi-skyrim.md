My 80 year old mother wants to try Skyrim... But

Post
I moved my mom in with me in the fall, and she's been looking over my shoulder when I play. Because I almost never fast travel, she mostly just sees a lot of beautiful scenery, but she's very concerned about fighting. She's a profoundly violence-adverse person, and I know she'll nope right out as soon as she hits Helgen.

Do you think it would be possible to put together s collection of mods that would let someone do a nonviolent playthrough? I think the game would be really good for her.

Comment
yes! alternate start lets you start as a property owner in any of the major holds. she can get right to trading and interacting with npc's while skipping the gruseome beginning in helgen and the cart scene entirely.
