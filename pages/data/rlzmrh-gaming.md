  - After watching the trailer before our first time playing she looked at me and asked if I thought our marriage was failing and that this was my way of telling her. This game really played the Uno-Reverse on me.

  - Edit: I don't think she was serious, it just made me laugh at the irony of that being her first thought. I probably should have conveyed that we tend to rib each other a lot. She is excited t try playing games with me. Who knows, maybe she's like a method actor when it comes to gaming.
