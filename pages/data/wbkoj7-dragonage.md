- Title
  - [DAI Spoilers] I had never heard of the Dragon Age games before. Husband recommended Inquisition to me two weeks ago since I've been on sick leave and not working. 125 hours of gameplay later, I just finished Trespasser and I'm obsessed with this game.

  - The music, the characters, the combat, the crafting, the exploration. It's all SO GOOD
  - I laughed many times, I cried a couple times, I stayed up all night playing more than once. I almost played Trespasser straight through without stopping because it was so engaging and amazing I felt like I couldn't put my controller down.
  - My husband is happy for me but also I'm sure there's a tiny, itty bit of him that secretly regretted showing me the game because he has hardly been able to use the console in two weeks lol.

  - Anyway I just joined this sub and found out about the next game and I'm so excited. Can't believe I never found this game before.
