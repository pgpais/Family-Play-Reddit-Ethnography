  - Grandma here - Need help w/PC download
- Post
  - My grandson watches videos of Spore all the time. I would like to get the game for him, to use on my computer, but I can't find it in stores. I also can't find it on things like Gamestop or Amazon to download. I do see it many places for free but I don't trust those type sites because I'm not as computer savvy as you young'uns. So how about helping an old lady out? How can I get this game for my grandson? I don't mind paying for it. Actually, I prefer to pay for it. Also, I don't have a gaming computer, just a regular old desktop with Windows Vista. Will Spore work on my computer? Thanks :0)

  - **EDIT** Steam account? Never heard of it but it sounds like the way to go. My grandson is only 8 so he doesn't have an account yet, but I will set him one up today. Thanks for all your help. I'll keep checking back for anymore helpful tidbits.

  - **EDIT (one day later)** Thanks everyone. I signed up for Steam and the Spore download was successful. My grandson has been playing it all day. When I brought him home, I started the download on the computer at his house. I hope it works as well for him there as it does here. If not, I'll know where to ask for help :0)

  - Hello there,
  - First of all you should try to know if your grandson has a Steam account (its an online game library).
  - If he has one, you have 2 possibilities :
  - 1.  you can create an account for yourself https://store.steampowered.com/join/?l=english and then buy the game http://store.steampowered.com/sub/1741/ . When purchasing Steam offers you the possibility to gift it to an existing account (your grandsons').
    1.  You can wait for him to come to your place, ask him to log into steam and buy him for him directly onto his account.
  - If he doesnt have a Steam account, see my 1. point, create him one and buy him the game :)
  - EDIT : Once the account is created, you need to download and install the Steam software http://store.steampowered.com/about/?l=english where you will be able to login with your account.
  - **EDIT2 :** Just so you know, if your computer can't handle SPORE, Steam has a nice refund policy : http://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds/ (14 days) I've personnaly never used it but it should work pretty well :)
  - ~~**EDIT3 :** Precision from /u/BloatedDog : "Steam refund policy is great but they ONLY refund your money in steam wallet form" So you wont be able to cash in the money back, but you can alway buy him another game !~~ Allright /u/BloatedDog lied to me :p
