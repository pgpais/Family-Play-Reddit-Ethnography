  - My 16 year old daughter is always geeking out on Skyrim.. She studies the wiki, she helps people on forums, She has over 400 hours in to the game. She has done pretty much everything there is to do and then some.. She cant stop talking about the dragonborn expansion so with that said.. I want to make her a Skyrim book like i have seen a couple people do on here. I dont have a huge budget but i want to make it badass! I found a pdf of all the skyrim books.. So this is where i need you guys..

  - 1.  Where is a good place to have the pages printed on good paper/cut/prepped
    2.  Where do i have it bound in something aged.. or old?
  - Appreciate any help!
  - **edit:** Wow! I never expected this kind of response! A Bookbinder got in touch with me and offered help. If financially it doesnt work out.. i will follow one of these guides and make it happen. Also I will try the tea wash on the pages and also singing a few of them to add to the aged look. I will probably also spring for the art book and dragon figure on ebay.. You guys are all so awesome! Thanks so much for all the ideas and help!
  - **2nd Edit:** For Clarification yes i am 28, yes she is 16.. she is my stepdaughter. I have had her as my daughter for 10 years now.. I also have another step daughter age 13.. and for you history crawlers.. the 3 year old Batgirl is my own daughter.
