- Title
  - Mom of 3 boys needs help with PS+
- Post
  - Not a gamer and I recently purchased a PS5 as a birthday present for my youngest son. I am overwhelmed on definitions of local coop, online coop, multiplayer, etc., but here is what I am trying to accomplish.

  - I want to purchase a ps+ account so that all 3 boys can play an online multiplayer game on the same ps5 at the same time. It's that possible or do I need 3 separate ps+ accounts?

  - Also, my middle son has a ps4 and has been asking for ps+ for a long time. Does this require another subscription as well? I can see this easily becoming another large household bill if I need 3 subscriptions on two separate systems.

  - If there are 2 PlayStations of different eras. (PS4 and a PS5) You only need one subscription. Whoeverâ€™s account the subscription was put onto (usually parents family co-ordinators account)needs to activate both devices as their primary device. It gets a lot trickier when you get a 3rd PlayStation
