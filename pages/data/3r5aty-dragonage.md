	- Here's our interpretations of the Champion herself and her trusty dwarf sidekick, on a limited budget! I adore Hawke and my little brother likes watching me play Dragon Age - Varric is his favorite - so we tried our hand at making some costumes : http://imgur.com/a/OLelc

	- Sorry for poor picture quality. Like I said, limited budget (:
	- Edit: You guys are awesome, thanks for all the lovely comments! I might just have to try my hand at this again sometime

	- Limited budget? Bah! You both are rocking in those outfits! Instantly tell who you each were dressed as, with little Varric pulling it off wonderfully. Nice crossbow, too. You as Hawke nail it perfectly. How'd you manage the pauldron and armor design? Sewing? However, it's fantastic!
