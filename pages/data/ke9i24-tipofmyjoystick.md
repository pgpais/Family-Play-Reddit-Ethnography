  - [PC] [2000+] Can’t find the game I used to watch my father play! Vaguely remember a cinematic with some guys messing up a demon summoning, but not much else :/ I watched him play when I was a child, so roughly 10 years ago.

  - Hello gamers!
  - Basically, I have been pulling my hair out about a game I can’t remember the name of!
  - As a child I used to watch my father play games a lot, and one game I faintly remember, but I can’t remember much apart from an opening cinematic!

  - The cinematic was some dudes trying to summon a demon, using a summoning circle, but one of them messes up the circle. I remember a demon coming out and reaching towards one of the guys, and the camera.
  - It’s super vague but I can’t for the life of me find out which game this was!
  - Would highly appreciate any help! :)

  - Sounds a bit like the intro to Diablo: Hellfire? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXaiNpmDJrw
