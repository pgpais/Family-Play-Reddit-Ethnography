- Title
  - I told off my husband for backseat gaming.
- Post
  - FTP here, LTL. I just felt like I had to share with other ladies who understand.
  - We're not very good, but our team plays regularly in comps and stuff. My style is very packrat-like. I carry things because my team might need them. Like I'm _known_ for coming in clutch with the gas can or ammo or other random shit. ^(Except meds, because I'm that unlucky.)
  - So when he comes in poking at my screen to remove the gas can from my backpack with baby crying/screaming/yelling/throwing tantrum to crawl in my lap because he thinks pointing out what I shouldn't be doing XYZ because ABC, you bet your shit that I'm gonna be annoyed. I muted my mic in our team's discord chat and laid into him calmly and firmly.

  - While I'm glad for having a supportive other half in gaming, I don't understand the double standard when he expects me to listen to his "suggestions" in how to play. I don't tell him how to play because we don't have the same style, also why would you try to do it when I'm getting shot at? It's like that stupid masculine gaming thing but we're married and he should know better. Afterwards, he sheepishly grabbed baby until the end of my turn during scrims.

  - hmph.
- Comment
  - This is why I despise playing any game with people watching me. An audience makes me nervous for starters because it turns the whole experience into a performance piece of sorts and gaming is supposed to be my outlet to relax. The back seat gaming kills that experience even more.
