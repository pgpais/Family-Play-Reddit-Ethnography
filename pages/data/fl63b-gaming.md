- Title
  - I knew my wife was a keeper when I married her, but she definitely verified it this weekend..
- Post
  - We were staying at a hotel this weekend as part of her yearly family reunion gathering. Her family knows how to party and many drinks were consumed, unfortunately as a result, we began to run low on our beer supply. We had brought a few cases with us but had left them in our car so we decided to drunkenly stumble to our car and grab the cases of beer, along with our other bags. It was really cold outside and we had no jackets so we were in a light jog, after loading up and locking the car, we started running back to the hotel, at which point she said(while struggling mightily) "I'm over-encumbered and can't run!". I dropped everything and kissed her.

  - update: Thanks for all the upvotes, i wasn't expecting this big of a reaction by any stretch. My wife came across this while browsing reddit at work, she said, "it must be in love if we made it to the front page of reddit."
