  - Hi,
  - I'm looking for a game with a robust chat system to talk to my little sister who lives part-time at my dad's house. My dad is a control-freak, so he won't let my little sister call or text me while she's there. In order for us to talk, she pretends like she's just playing a game, and when dad's not watching, she flips open a chat window and talks to me.

  - For a few months, I've been using a game called Bit Heroes to chat with her, but recently the devs updated the game to use WebGL instead of Flash. Now the game is super glitchy and it crashes a lot. So I need to use another game to talk to her now.
  - I use macOS as my primary OS, so I would need a game that is cross-platform. My little sister only has an Android tablet, so the game has to work on that too.
  - Basically I just want the chat system to have the following capabilities:
  - I can copy & paste messages (so I can save the messages on my computer in case they're important).
  - Private messages - not just public chat that is open to the world.
  - Ideally, we would have an unlimited number of messages or at least a high number before it starts cutting off.
  - I don't need super fancy features like formatting or images, just a plain-text chat system is fine. But I also wouldn't mind having slightly more advanced features too.
  - I would appreciate any suggestions. Thanks!

  - Might I recommend a little thing called "Child Protective Services". The fact that you want to be able to copy messages "in case they're important" is incredibly worrying to me.
