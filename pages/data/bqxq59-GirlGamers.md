	- Got my husband hooked on Stardew Valley!
- Post
	- So both my husband and I have had a really stressful week, and he's been looking for games to play other than Sekiro and BOTW. Sekiro adds to his stress sometimes, and he's finished BOTW multiple times. I made him buy Stardew Valley to play with me, because I wanted to just chill in a single player game, but also hang out with him. So he bought it without seeing any gameplay. This morning when I woke up, I heard the sounds of Stardew Valley coming from our computer room. He wanted to know if I was going to play! It makes me pretty happy since we usually don't agree on games to play or get.

	- My wife and I play as well, if you play on computer I think the beta of multiplayer is going on for Stardew, if you have a console I think it comes out later this year.
