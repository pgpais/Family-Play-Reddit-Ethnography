/u/hru321, my brother is pretty new to gaming. However, he really enjoyed the gameplays I showed him and is eager to play the game once the download completes. I'll be getting a controller to join him as well. After I told him about you, here's what he said (translated):

>hru321 (I hope I said it right, haha) thanks a lot for the game. My brother asked for some interesting animal facts yesterday and I had no idea why. Well, now I know. My brother knows a lot more about animals and yet he decided to use the fact I stated to enter the competition. It makes me happy to think that this helped us win.

>We'd love to play with you sometimes if it's possible. This just made my day a lot better. I hope you too have a great day. Again, thanks a lot for the game.

I thank you for this kind gesture and I look forward to all the fun this game has to offer :)

P.s. Here's few more interesting facts:

1. The **blue whale** (*Balaenoptera musculus)* has 3 stomach chambers with a total of 4 compartments.
2. The throat of a **blue whale** is narrow and usually measures less than 1 ft. wide.
3. (Not exactly an animal fact) The Mediterranean orchid *Ophrys* employs 'sexual deceit' to get pollination done by a species of bee. One of its petals has a striking resemblance to the female of the bee in size, colour and markings leading to 'pseudocopulation' by the male bee resulting in pollination. (Ngl, they got the bees in both the halves.)

I'm happy you both like the game, and I wish you two many good hunts :)
