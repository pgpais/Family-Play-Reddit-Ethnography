- Title
	- [KH3][Other] I'll be playing this game in honor of my mom
- Post
	- I don't want this to be a pity party or a sob story but I just wanted to share what this franchise means to me.
	- When I was 12 my friend let me borrow KH1 and I didn't know what it was but I saw that it was made by Square and was a mix between Disney and Final Fantasy, gave it a go and after the final credits I begged my mom to buy me a copy. After following the series throughout the years I would talk to my mom about the games and the characters, the worlds, my convoluted theories and she loved hearing about it.

	- 5 Years ago she was diagnosed with liver cancer and fought hard, went to remission and was diagnosed again last year. Before she passed away I spent time with her and she wanted to see the series first hand. I replayed the whole series for her, she watched, laughed and even cried at moments. I showed her all the latest trailers for KH3 and promised her we would play it together. Although she didn't get to see it I will still be playing it for her. This series taught me to appreciate the people around me and to keep my friends and family close. This game will be bittersweet for me but I look forward to seeing how it ends.
