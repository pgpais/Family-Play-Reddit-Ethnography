	- Mom plays Doom.....poorly
- Post
	- So a while back I started to let my kids choose games they wanted to see me play and stream my reaction to said games.
	- WELP last night they chose Doom. The last time I played that game was early 90s when I was in elementary school. My dad owned a computer shop and I would spend the weekends there and play games. So there's some nostalgia there. The only thing is I get motion sickness pretty easily even when I played the original version, so I could only play in short bursts. Turns out motion sickness still a thing with that game lol.
	- Anyway, the kids had sooooo much fun watching me play because I was swearing like a sailor and yelling at the demons. Last night was the first time I incorporated streaming and it had like 6 views lol.

	- Any tips for streaming? And how do you save your streams to videos so you can look back on them?

	- What are you streaming on? Twitch should automatically save the vods and I think YouTube does as well.
