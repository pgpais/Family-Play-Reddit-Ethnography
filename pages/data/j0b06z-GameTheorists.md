  - Is minecraft Steve a robot?
  - He doesn't need to drink water, can survive in ice forever, and whenever an animal or something else dies, particles fly out of their body, maybe that's the water in their system evaporating? Steve doesn't have those particles when he dies, because he doesn't drink water. It would also explain why he can respawn. My brother had a lot more evidence but those are all I can remember
