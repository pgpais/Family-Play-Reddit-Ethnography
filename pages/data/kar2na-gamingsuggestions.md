	- My dad is in his 60s and is a novice gamer at best. We used to play some of the 007 games back in the day when I was younger and he loves picking the "explosive" weapons like rpg's and grenade launchers and just blasting away. I tried to introduce him to the COD series about 10 years ago, but the gameplay is too advanced and complicated for him. He keeps hinting that he wants to play video games where he can just "blow sh** up" and relieve some stress, but I'm not sure what to get him. Are there any shooter games that are easy to play where the object of the game is just explosions and blowing up enemies? He's a computer engineer so I could get him something for his pc, or I wouldn't mind getting a console for him just so he could play a game that fits this description. Any suggestions would be appreciated, thank you in advance.

	- Just cause 3
	- Blowing shit up is the main purpose!
	- Lots of fun. I played it through 3 times in a row, using the steam controller, very relaxing!
