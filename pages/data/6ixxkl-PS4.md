Old man here. What are some good FAMILY friendly games I can get for the grandkids?

Post
I don't want any of this World War I killing shit, I did enough of that in 'Nam... just kidding.

The kids are 6 and 9 and their dad has a PS4 at home. Anything single player or multiplayer.

Last game I played was Donkey Kong Country on a Nintendo. Looking for good family fun like that. Thank you lads!
