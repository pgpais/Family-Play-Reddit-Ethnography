	- I played, wife watched, part 2 is over and now we have an issue.

	- Now unfortunately every other game I play looks like ass in comparison. My wife is not a gamer but this was the first time she was truly invested in a game I played. It was like watching an amazing tv series together. It was awesome.
	- However, I don't know where to go from here. Every game I open (and really good games by the way) inevitably gets compared to TLOU 2 and obviously that's a pretty high bar. I just tried a spider-man dlc mission and it's a great fun game, graphics look amazing. Still, it's not doing it for us for some reason. Uncharted 4 would obviously come to mind but I already played it and while I loved it immensely, it didn't quite click with her. I haven't tried god of war yet. Maybe that can feed our narrative hunger? Or maybe we need a palate cleanser to try for a while. Something with zero narrative, like a race game or smth.
	- Anyways, my question is this; what did you play after finishing TLOU 2? You finish the game, how do you move on?
	- Edit: you know what? I just remembered I have A Plague Tale from my plus library. I bet that could be a nice one!

	- I had to stop gaming for a few months after playing part 2. Nothing compares
