	- My dad reached level 43 now and was wondering why he didn't come across any dragons and can't learn shouts. Well had a look at his story history... this man didn't do the first main mission, he just didn't want to go into the Bleak Falls Barrow to get the stone with the golden claw haha. Didn't know this was possible and the fact he's level 43. Can't stop laughing. ðŸ˜‚
