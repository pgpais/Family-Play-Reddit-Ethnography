[Question] I really want to get Lego Harry Potter for my nephew but they only have a PS4. Is there anyway to download/play it?

My nephew is 3 and just starting to play games. My cousin, his father, loved Harry Potter when we were younger so I thought it'd be the perfect gift for the two of them. 

Unfortunately, the game is only for last gen consoles and as I recently found out, the PS4 lacks backwards compatibility. Is there anyway for them to play it on the PS4?
