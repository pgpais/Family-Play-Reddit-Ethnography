	- My wife did something that I never did in a year and a half of playing...
- Post
	- She was riding in West Elizabeth around Strawberry when she was jumped by the O’Dingbats. She survived the attack but.. her horse Quaker didn’t. Devastated.

	- But in a surprising move, she picked up her saddle and started walking. She was determined to find a new horse. She walked the whole way to Cattail Pond (almost an entire day in-game). There, she found and broke her first wild horse, a beauty of a chocolate-coated Tennessee Walker. With a huge smile she rode to the stables in Valentine and named him Cattail to remember overcoming this struggle.

	- In all the time that I’ve played, I’ve never experienced traveling on foot that far through the world. Wanted to share this cool moment :)

	- I once had my horse downed but not killed, but I didn’t have a reviver. I ran down the road for several minutes until I saw a guy on a horse. I proceed to steal the guys horse, ride it all the way to valentine, buy a reviver, ride back to my downed horse, and revive him. I don’t know what I would have done if he’d died.
