- Title
  - **THAT MOM** that calls everything a Nintendo here again with an update. He was so happy he cried!
- Post
  - Firstly, thanks to everyone that offered advice and help.
  - Secondly, we decided that, due to the sheer volume of items and the costs involved with it, we would give him the PS4 and VR from us, and Santa would bring the bike and other toys.
  - We took your advice to give it to him early so that we wouldn't have to wait if the network got messed up on Christmas, and put everything under the tree, unwrapped, and then the fun began. He was in his room playing Minecraft with some of his friends and my husband called him into the living room to make him a drink of water. He walked past the tree and didn't even notice it! Then I called him back to get me something out of my purse on the kitchen table...he walked past it again without noticing it! We literally had him walk past the tree 10 times to do things, and he never once noticed it. Finally I had him plug up the tree lights, and he finally noticed all the PS4 boxes.

  - He screamed and burst into tears! He kept saying, "I just love you guys so much!" It took a good 10 minutes to calm him down.

  - We sat everything up...all the cables...all the accounts...moved furniture so he could play...He was so excited...He was going to play a PS VR...His PS VR!...he sat down on the couch, grabbed the headset to put it on, and then husband snatched it out of his hands and told him, "If you break it, I'll break you. I hope you didn't want to go to college, because your about to play away your college education...After I play first!" And then the husband sat down and played the VR before he could.

  - After about 10 minutes of bragging about how cool it was and how amazing, and "Don't you wish you were me, so you could be playing right now?" the husband passed it over to him and the kiddo had his mind blown.

  - Rundown of what the kiddo got:
    - PS4 1TB
    - PS VR
    - PS Camera
    - 2 Motion controllers
    - Extra "normal" controller
    - $100 PS store giftcard (already gone and then some! He got Until Dawn: Rush of Blood, Job simulator, Eve: Valkyrie, Star Wars Battle front, ARK survival, Robinson the Journey, and pre-ordered Resident Evil for me!)
    - Batman VR
    - Plants vs Zombies
    - Lego Batman 3
  - We also signed up for the PSNOW rental thing.
  - I've been playing it... Mostly the Blood Rush game...Holy crap its scary as shit!
  - Thanks again from all of [us!](http://imgur.com/a/xMGyo) Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
  - EDIT: I just woke up to go to work, and holy shit balls! Thanks for all of this. Just to clarify, I did spend a lot of money, but my husband and I did not get each other gifts this year. This is a family gift for all of us, and it is something that we can do as a family. We discussed it length about the pros and cons, and decided to go for it after our kid told us that we didn't need to buy him one, and that he'd be happy either way.

  - We are not rich...far from it. Ive worked 60+ hours for the past 4 months to afford this. He understood that we were short handed at work, and that I was saving for Christmas. I told him that we were paying for a cruise that we had already paid for. A lot of blood, sweat, and tears went into this gift, but in the end, we are happy with our decision.

  - While I was sleeping today, my husband played it most of the day while the kiddo was at a kid's camp for his Christmas break. I seriously think that it is mostly a gift for him, that was intended for the kiddo.
  - Thanks for the gold! The kiddo was just as excited to be on the front page of r/PS4 as he was setting the system up. He loves reddit as much as I do.
