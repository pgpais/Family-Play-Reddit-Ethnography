Title
[WSIB] Co-op games to play with my dad, to get us talking and encourage our relationship?

Post
So, my dad and I have a somewhat complicated relationship. We often don't see each other for months at a time, which doesn't help. But we do both love gaming and play Xbox.

We agreed we should start talking more, so we can work towards 'healing' and a better relationship. It's kind of awkward to just talk though, so I suggested we play some games together online and start from there.

So far we've been playing Unravel 2, and having a good time!

Our tastes are similar. We both really like adventure games and puzzles, but also quest completion and survival stuff. We both love achievement hunting. We will give anything a go though, especially if it will encourage us to work together. 

I've heard good things about 'It Takes Two', but also heard that from only a couple's perspective, whereas we would be playing as father/daughter.

So, I'm looking for suggestions for what we can play next to keep us positively engaged together!

Thanks for any suggestions!
