	- If you have Game Pass, get Halo MCC, I just spent 5 hours last night playing it with family and friends and the overall experience was some of the best I’ve ever had.

	- **TL;DR Halo Master Chief Collection delivers on the promises and it works. It’s as fun as it was 11 years ago and with an open mind and game pass, I encourage people to join in, endure the learning curve, bring some friends, make new ones and hopefully have some fun.**
	- I’ve been playing Xbox Live since Rainbow Six 3. My dad has played video games since the NES and Halo CE was no exception. My mum dabbled in puzzle games and Sim City here and there but things really kicked off for her when she joined my dad and Me with Halo CE. We all have our own gamer tags. I’m from Australia and I’ve since moved overseas. Playing Xbox live together can be a challenge but it’s a 10 year long tradition that we’ve kept up. Friday Night is Live night with the fam.

	- MCC was supposed to be everything we wanted in a Halo game and it didn’t deliver. We all know it. So when MCC was finally seeing it’s full potential this month it was met with cautious optimism.
	- But I can really say, it delivered.
	- Last night I was playing my parents who still live in Australia, with me at the east coast US, a couple of my friends and Halo 3 Big team battle. It was clean, (4K HDR), smooth (steady 60fps) and not once did my dad whine about lag. Which is new to Halo for my dad at least.

	- Partying up was smooth and easy. Seeing other friends playing was great and I invited them to join. Once we hit matchmaking we found games very quickly. The first match was the most challenging, getting back into the old groove. Damn Halo 3 feels slow. But we endured and slowly got used to leading our BR shots and getting kills.

	- We lost.
	- But it was still fun. We kept it up. We got better. Coordinated more. Picked up a few randoms (5 of us were playing so we always had 3 randoms). The game doesn’t feel so slow any more when you’re in the midst of vehicles and intense firefights. Things REALLY kicked into gear when we got Neutral Bomb on Stand Off.
	- Between the beautiful HDR lighting on a sunset level and the havoc of trying to coordinate an attack or holding the base, there was just something that was pure fun when humming the Indiana Jones theme while cruising in the Warthog only to be completely obliterated by a Splaser 10 seconds later. And the explosions, vehicle destruction, lighting and debris are somehow still just as satisfying.
	- I loved every second of this experience. When we lost we laughed, when we won we cheered. This is something I can’t wait to bring my own kids in on to join in fragging with Grammy and Papa.

	- EDIT: Thank you 343 For the work out into this game. That wait sucked but the pay off was huge.
	- EDIT2: thanks to u/khfan60 for reminding me that right now we have a fairly limited playlist that is going to expand to include more memorable modes and more varied content like SWAT and infection. I also recommend people’s check out Action Sack for the time being :)

	- I bought that title at launch, and tested out the update with a friend today. Still fun.
