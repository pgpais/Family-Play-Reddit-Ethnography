	- Video games have always been a pain point for my marriage. Been married for 5 years now and I constantly get hassled for playing video games. I'll be the first to admit, I probably play a bit too much but my wife also admittedly gets irrationally unnerved by it. She claims it makes me somewhat of an adolescent in her mind sometimes which comes from a bit of a misnomer of video games in general and the stigma of the industry to the general public.

	- Over the years, we've made some compromises and she has never forced me to completely stop playing and did what she could to quell her frustration. I really thank her for that. I also tried to introduce her to some good couch coop games but nothing stuck.

	- Well I'm writing all of you now as she is sitting playing games for the 2nd day straight all thanks to Call of the Sea! Feels like a hell of a breakthrough. We talked about it nonstop at dinner and it seems like she was finally able to immerse herself in this world claiming, she felt as if she were a character in a pixar movie.

	- She mentioned she clearly had no idea video games stepped out of the world of first person COD-like shooters into something story or exploration driven. She says she totally understands the immersion and already asked me for similar games. I've downloaded the witness, edith finch, and yooka-laylee (she liked games like mario 64 when she was younger).

	- Anyway, BIG THANKS to the Call of the Sea devs for making such an approachable and fascinating game. You've opened a big door for my wife and I.
