- Title
  - WSIB- An easy-to-learn game for my senior grandpa? (Age 65+)
- Post
  - Hi everyone,
  - I gave my grandpa my original PlayStation 4 a couple years back when I bought the upgraded version (PS4 Pro), and he plays it every single day. He thoroughly enjoys playing video games in his downtime, but he only plays a handful of games that are easy to learn. He's a huge baseball fan, so I've gotten him into playing Super Mega Baseball--I bought him the new Super Mega Baseball that came out a month or two ago. He also plays Minecraft pretty heavily, but he only ever plays creative mode. He enjoys the building aspect, but he has a hard time learning the mechanics of survival mode. He's a _super_ casual, but I really like to encourage him to play video games because it's supposedly good for maintaining cognitive ability in seniors. For a little backstory, both his mother and aunt were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in their early 80s; his mother died from the disease about 8 years ago, and his aunt died from it early this year. My fear is that it's hereditary for our family, and I don't want to see him go that way. While it may not make sense in reality, the fact that he plays video games makes me feel more comfortable about his chances of developing Alzheimer's. In my mind, if he still plays Minecraft every day, at least I know he's not starting to forget things.

  - Lately I have been encouraging him to try some new games, but I have no idea what he would be interested in. He doesn't really like to play games that have a big learning curve, he wouldn't really enjoy games made for mature audiences, but it can't be blatantly "for kids," either. I tried to get him to play Terraria before, and he played it for a little while with me, but I don't think he enjoyed it enough to play on his own. He didn't really grasp the survival aspect of it. I have thought about having him try to play Skyrim or other Bethesda games, but I am uncertain whether it would be too hard for him. Although, I could adjust the difficulty to make it easy for him. Heâ€™s not really into online games either, but I could suggest it.

  - Basically, I am searching for a game that could be enjoyed in a very casual and laid back manner, by people of all ages. I would really appreciate any suggestions given.
- Comment
  - You can play unravel 2 and a way out with him.
  - Both couch coop games.
  - A way out has a story.
  - Unravel 2 is chill coop game. Wherever it is a bit difficult, he can piggyback on you.
  - Try these games.
