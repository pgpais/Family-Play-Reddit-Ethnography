  - I've been working six days a week and my wife is stuck on with the one year old. We don't get a ton of time together, but I want to find an enjoyable game that helps us both relax. I love open world games that involve self-created goals, collecting (achievements, drops, whatever), and exploration and trading (I love stocking up on one thing at one place, then hauling it somewhere else for a profit). She would want a game that is simple to learn, doesn't involve interacting with strangers, and probably open-world with collectibles as well, but probably with less combat...I don't think she enjoys challenging fights at all.

  - Here is a list of some of the games we've played and our reactions to them:
  - Minecraft - We both really enjoy playing Minecraft together…the only problem is we play it very differently. I enjoy building a world with little stories and mini-dungeons in it. I enjoy building large towns with different shops and places to explore. She enjoys….well, honestly, she enjoys building large basements and packing them with chests for stuff. I think she just loves the therapeutic clearing of land, to be honest. The problem becomes…she doesn’t want to explore the areas I build, and eventually gets bored when she finishes her project and wants to restart, leaving all my hard work to be discarded when we make a new world, which is disheartening to me.

  - Raft - This one is great! We’ve played it a couple of times now, and are probably going to play it again soon. She enjoys the exploration and storyline, and I enjoy designing and building the ship. We can play at our own pace and set our own goals, but still work together.

  - Terraria - I really like Terraria because of how much content is in it and how much there is to collect and to do, but she doesn’t enjoy it as much. I think because it is more content oriented than most games, which frustrates her because she dies more often and doesn't really enjoy combat that much anyways.

  - Gloomhaven - We both enjoyed Gloomhaven at first, but the difficulty has brought our game to a halt. We may keep playing it at the easiest difficulty, but I think both of us feel a bit frustrated that we’d have to do so. But spending our rare free time together to fail the same dungeons over and over again is frustrating. Maybe if there is something similar that is easier, we’d enjoy it.

  - Saint’s Row - We both enjoyed this. The insane action was fun, and the “conquering" of different districts was fun too. By the last one we played (which was before the new one game out), the game itself had gotten a little out of hand and was a bit easy with two players...but it was still a fun experience.

  - Borderlands - I enjoyed Borderlands, but I think she just found it “meh”. We played the first two together, but stopped close to the end of the Pre-Sequel. Probably mostly my fault…I picked Claptrap and I think his special ability causing her to also do random things frustrated her.
  - Elite Dangerous - I would love to find a space game she’d enjoy, but I’m not sure if one exists. I love the concept of being able to decide what I want to do…be it trading or fighting or exploring. But the learning curb here frustrated her endlessly. Having to click this, click that, go here, go there, all just to enable warp drive had her angry most of the time.

  - Stardew Valley - She really loved Stardew Valley….even more than I did, honestly! But it wasn’t a multi-player success, mostly due to how the game handles time. In single player, the game pauses in menus and whatnot, giving you time to sort through your stuff without worrying about the clock running down and the day ending. But in multiplayer, it doesn’t do this, resulting in game days that feel about twice as short as they do in single player. Honestly, that was the only draw back though…a similar game without a need for sleep so that it became less of an issue would probably go over well.

  - Civilization - I thought this would be right up her alley, but I think she was mostly bored by it. Since it involves a lot more "moving parts", so to speak, I think she kind of got bored being tied down by all the minutia.WoW and FFXIV - She enjoyed these MMOs. She hated group content (she doesn’t like interacting with strangers), but she enjoyed collecting things and completing achievements.

  - EDIT: For those wondering, I've counted up some of the votes. It isn't perfect...I probably missed some, but by FAR It Takes Two is the most recommended. VERY Recommended:
  - It Takes Two - 19 Votes  
    Valheim - 7 Votes  
    No Man's Sky - 6 Votes  
    Lego Games, Grounded, A Way Out - 5 Votes  
    Lovers in a dangerous space time, Astroneer, Portal 2 - Four Votes
  - And then a lot of others. This has been truly amazing...thank you everyone for replying! I'm so excited I have a list now! I'm going to show it to her so she can pick some to try out....but I think we're going to have to try It Takes Two first. :-D It is on sale, and apparently two people can play with only one purchase, possibly without having to rely on Steam Remote Play. Awesome!
