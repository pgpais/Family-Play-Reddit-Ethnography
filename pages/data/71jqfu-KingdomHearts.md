  - We beat KH1 on Proud, just beat KHII on proud, and got through _most_ of Re:COM before I switched to PS4 and didn't want to go through all that stuff again.
  - She got excited every time a new world popped up that she knew, and the only ones she didn't know (Port Royal and Timeless River) she seemed interested in learning more about them.
  - She loved how Pete is part of the story now, and she understands most of the Organization's plot and such, although she keeps thinking Luxord is Ansem (She's blind in one eye).
  - She's deeply engrossed in the story so far, and can't wait for the next one (We'll be watching the 358/2 cutscenes). She also loves my Donald voice, as she can't understand him and I give him a deep, masculine voice.
  - If you guys want, I'll post her reactions to the story and games from now on, and feel free to ask questions!
  - EDIT: Forgot to mention I let her kill Xemnas. At the end, when he's stunned and needs one last hit, I had her press triangle and use Thundaga. She liked being the one that beat him.

  - EDIT: Had a shield made with her name and her favorite keyblade for Christmas. She loves it. [Feel free to look!](https://www.reddit.com/r/KingdomHearts/comments/7mypeb/discussion_got_a_shield_made_for_my_10_yo/)

  - My niece is the same way. She loves watching me play Kingdom Hearts because of the Disney princesses. She always seems to bring up Kingdom Hearts whenever she's at my house.
