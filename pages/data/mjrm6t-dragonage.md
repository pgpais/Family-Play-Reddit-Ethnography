- Title
  - [DA2 Spoilers] I explained to my mom the plot of DA2 (I only got to act 2 though)
    tags:: [[Kinship/Parent]] [[Media Component/Narrative]] [[Shared Experiences/Discussing Aspects of game]]
- Post
  - Here are some highlights.
  - 1.  The dwarves
  - Mom: Wait, so I can't romance a dwarf?
  - Me: Nope
  - Mom: But what if I want to? Are the developers racist against them?
  - Me: I dunno, but when I saw Varric I was like "why cant I tap that?"
  - 2.  After the first Anders quest
  - Me: You have now found out Anders is posessed, you talk to him and he hits on you. Do you flirt back?
  - Mom: Yes
  - Me: Do you want to hear about the other romance options or is he your choice?
  - Mom: Oh no, I want to hear about everyone else first.
  - 3.  After the first Fenris quest
  - Me: You get out of his mansion, he sees you're a mage and doesn't like you. He talks about himself some more and now you have the opportunity to hit on him. Do you do it?
  - Mom: Yes.
  - 4.  Picking the romance option
  - Me: Ok, because you only wanna hear about the guys, your options are the former slave with the tragic backstory or the posessed hobo rebel. Who do you pick?
  - Mom: Hobo rebel.
  - Me: Oh. Uh,,,,
  - 5.  The Deep Roads
  - Me: Then you find a weird idol and Varric's brother runs away with it, locking you up in that temple.
  - Mom: WHAT A PIECE OF SHIT
  - 6.  My obvious frothing rage when talking about act 2 and the whole Qunarj plot (and I didnt even get to rant about Petrice and Saarebas)
- Comment
  - I lost it at 'HOBO REBEL' ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
  - Now I really want to know how your Mom responds when she finds out what Hobo Rebel does. Please send updates.
