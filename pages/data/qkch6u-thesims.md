  - My wife has been playing Sims but recently wants it a bit more exciting so we have agreed that I would go on without her knowledge and change things , stage a burglary or anything to make it more interesting and random. So what little things could I change that would just be irritating ?

  - You could install sacrificialmod's Tragedy mod. I think that's what it called. I'm pretty sure it causes random traumatic events. Burglary, sim dies in car crash, etc.
