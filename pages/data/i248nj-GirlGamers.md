	- My grandma was a girl gamer and I am super proud of her for that. She was proof that you are never too old to be a gamer girl!

	- My grandmother passed away in 2014, but I've been thinking about her a lot lately. I was a 90's child (born in 87), so my gaming experience started when I was a very small kid with the Super Nintendo. My grandmother was born in 1930, so she was far from a spring chicken in the 90's. I used to play Zelda, Super Mario Kart, etc.. had a lot of classic titles for the SNES.
	- One day I asked her to play Mario Kart with me and she did. She never really got the hang of that, but when I got stuck in Zelda, I asked her to try to get me out of it. Attempting to get me out of my stuck spot turned into my grandmother starting her own game. The SNES was in my bedroom, and my grandparents lived with us to help my single mother. It became a nightly ritual where she would come into my room when it was bed time and sit on the end of my bed and play Zelda while I watched until I fell asleep. She beat Zelda before I did.

	- When the Sega Genesis came out, she was responsible for me receiving it for Christmas. We would play Sonic 3 together, Puggsy (most people have never heard of this game) and Columns 3.

	- As I grew older and moved on to things like Playstation and the Sega became outdated, I gave it to my grandmother when she and my grandfather moved out. She kept it right up to her death, along with my Playstation 2 that I eventually passed on to her.

	- I can only imagine what kind of games my grandma would like now if she were still alive.
	- I just wanted to share how proud I am of my grandmother for coming out of her comfort zone and getting into something "only the kids" were doing. She didn't care, she enjoyed playing video games, and it gave me so many fond memories that I will always cherish.
