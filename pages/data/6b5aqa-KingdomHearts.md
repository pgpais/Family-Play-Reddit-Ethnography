- Title
  - [KH1] Story of my Nephew playing KH1
- Post
  - The past two days my 4 year old nephew was over and he saw my 1.5+2.5 game case and was adamant on playing. I thought it would be too hard for him but I humored him. I started a new KH1 game. He did figured out how to walk and spam the attack button. So he killed random encounters while I did the harder parts. He was pretty proud when he learned how to jump out of a hole by jumping and moving at the same time. We made it to Tarzan's world before he had to go.

  - What surprised me was he was interested in the story. He kept asking me questions on what was happening. Which I had my work cut out for me. Two cute things that happened were I asked him what he wanted to name the raft. He said "Riku" and I asked why and he said "because Riku is Sora's friend." That make me go aww. Also I told him Kairi was in Sora's heart which kinda confused him because she kept randomly showing up but he accepted it. Then we found a chest with puppies and I told him that we can take them home. He said "Where are the puppies? Are they in Sora's heart too?"
