Wife: "Are you playing that, what is it, Skymall again?"

Post
Look.  It's not hysterical, but it is cute.  As you down-vote, please consider that I am playing this game in social isolation.  Nobody I am close to is playing and therefore, I have no one but this subReddit as a community to learn from and share with.  I'll take my lumps though.

I will add, that I haven't visited any other part of Reddit since I started playing.  I no longer care about all the shitty stuff going on in the real world - which, now that I think about, it is a huge relief.

That isn't so bad.. My wife says "are you rimming again?" 

Makes me feel dirty.
