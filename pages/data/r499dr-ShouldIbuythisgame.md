Title
Help a dad pick the best Pokemon game for Christmas

Post
I've never played a Pokemon game before, and the reviews I find online vary wildly. It's hard to tell which is the best one.

My son has never played anything other than the free demo versions of Quest, Unite and Let's Go Evee. Evee was his favorite. The Switch is his first Nintendo, so there is no nostalgia factor. He likes collecting the cards, and reading about Pokemon in the guide books. Thanks for your recommendations.

EDIT: Thanks to everyone who took the time to respond. I was leaning towards Sword/Shield, but one of you kind strangers gifted us with a download code for Sword. So that's where our Pokemon adventure begins!

Let's Go Eevee and Pikachu is the outright easiest of them. It's good for young kids or total novices to games, but lacks a heavy amount of depth. It's a remake of the first Pokemon games, but they also made GBA remakes earlier, FireRed and LeafGreen, that are significantly more deep. There's a reason they gave them the "Let's Go" title instead of calling them an official game.

Sword/Shield are the mainline titles for Switch. This is probably the safest bet for a first Pokemon game as they are the most visually impressive and rich with features and content. Exploration looks really nice, like a modern console game. They also have a DLC for even more content.

Brilliant Diamond Shining Pearl are the deepest since they are relatively 1:1 remakes of the games for Nintendo DS. They are probably the "hardest", if you could call any Pokemon game on Switch hard. However, visually they are lackluster and full of glitches so it wouldn't be my first choice.
