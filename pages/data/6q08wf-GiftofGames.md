	- [REQUEST][STEAM] Playerunknown's Battlegrounds so I can play with my bro
- Post
	- Greetings fellow gamers. This is my first time on this subreddit, but it certainly looks impressive! I am hoping to get a copy of [PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS](http://store.steampowered.com/app/578080/PLAYERUNKNOWNS_BATTLEGROUNDS/) so I can play with my brother while we each attend college 1,000 miles apart (actually 1,005 miles to be precise). My Steam ID is [GiantDwarf01](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198040676166/)

	- **What is this so called "Playerunknown's Battlegrounds?**
	- Well, I'm sure everyone has heard of this game by now, but if not, PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is a online 'Last-Man-Standing' survival game. You're basically dropped onto an island or map and try to find equipment and survive in an ever shrinking battlefield. It's currently in early access, but according to my brother, it's really well done and is constantly being improved. It seems to be a fun game, and the important part for me, is there is a co-op game mode apparently that my brother and I can play together on.
	- **Why do I want this?**
	- Because it's one of the only games my brother plays that's online currently. Before we both went to college, we would play a lot of local multiplayer games on consoles and such. Alas, our college careers took us to different parts of the country, one of us to Denver, the other to Chicago. I'm a comp sci major, so I've always had an interest in computers and PC games, but only recently has my brother joined the PC gaming world. And it's easier for me to just play games he's interested in rather than trying to convince him to try games that I already have. And if we're able to play games together, like we used to, I'm hoping our relationship will remain solid rather than weakening as I hear other families have done due to college. That, plus the fact I literally have no friends after a year at college means I've been fairly lonely and he is my best friend. But at the moment, my access to new games is a bit limited...

	- **Why am I too poor for this game?**
	- Because the first few weeks of school is the tightest budget wise - them math and comp sci books ain't cheap ya know. That, plus I haven't been able to find a good part-time job since I moved to school, means I don't have much in the way of disposable income for video games... I may have an internship lined up for down the road but at the moment... not so much.

	- So yeah, that's my story, not sure if I formatted everything right for this and I didn't miss any of the rules... But yeah, thanks for taking the time to read this!

	- I got you fam. I won PUBG from GOG, and I just came into $30. Was gonna buy a game for myself, but this is a better use for it. Welcome to the sub (club)! ;)
