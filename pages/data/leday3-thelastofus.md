- Title
  - My Mom beat TLOU for the first time.
- Post
  - I convinced my mom to play part 1 months ago and we have played on an off on the weekends. She just finished the story and is so excited to see part 2! She did pretty well for somebody that hasn't ever touched a ps4 controller before but I thought I'd just share that she enjoyed it!

  - Please remember to tell us how she feels about part 2. I am really curious.
