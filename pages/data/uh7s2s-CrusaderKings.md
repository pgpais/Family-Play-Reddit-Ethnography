Title
Played CK3 with my mom for the first time tonight

Post
We played as a player-made Khatun of the Kirghiz Khanate. My mom had a giant knight in her court and immediately fell in love with the character, and had the married Khatun seduce him in the hopes of, in her words, "getting a giant baby." She romanced him too, and after he died in the same battle that took the Khatun's leg, she went on to romance a genius giant lunatic for her "collection of men." She also tried to have her husband killed a few times in order to replace him with a giant, but the intrigue was too low.

She takes after me.
