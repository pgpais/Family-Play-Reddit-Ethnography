  - Any recommendations for some story driven games that we can really get lost in would be appreciated

  - The Last of Us
  - Uncharted 1-4
  - Bioshock Collection (the first two are a little scary)
  - Fallout 4
  - Until Dawn (Horror Game)
  - Life Is Strange (haven't played the sequel so I'll reserve my judgment.)
  - Assassins Creed: Black Flag (probably the weakest of the list but I still enjoyed it AC: Origins looks pretty promising as well but I'm not holding my breath.)
    The Ezio Collection is the PS3 AC games and they are god tier back in the day not sure if they still hold up
  - Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain
  - The Witcher 3
  - Watch Dogs 1 & 2 (Side note: Watch Dogs 1 is universally hated by the gaming community but that's because it was a victim of being over hyped and the story was a little weak but I still got a kick out of it. Watch Dogs 2 on the other hand is much better.)
  - Far Cry 4 was okay but primal was pretty bad Far Cry 5 also looks promising
  - LA Noire Remastered comes out next month definitely give that game a shot
  - That's all for now I'll add if anything comes across my mind.
