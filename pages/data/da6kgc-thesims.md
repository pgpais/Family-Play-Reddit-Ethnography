- Title
  - When I was a kid I got my mom hooked on The Sims (original)...
- Post
  - She was super into building homes and she’d always show me her finished product. Then we got The Sims 2 and I taught her to download mods. She would spend hours on that game. That’s really all she knew how to do on the computer was put the disc in and start the game or download mods. She didn’t know how to turn off the computer or anything.

  - One time I decided to prank her when she was showing me her finished build. She was giving me a tour and I reached over and turned the monitor off and laughed. She collapsed her head into her hands and was so upset. She said, “Oh, my, god, Nicky, I didn’t save it!!”

  - I just kept laughing and reached over and turned the monitor back on and then died laughing.
  - One of my favorite memories that my mom and I still joke about to this day.
