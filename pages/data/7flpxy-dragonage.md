- Title
  - [DA2 spoilers] My sister and Anders
- Post
  - Hi everyone it's me again. I feel like I use this account to lurk, occasionally drop some terrible content and then scuttle for the hills. And I am here to do that again today, because I was just reminded of a conversation that I had with my twin sis a bit ago when she played DA2 for the first time. It was pretty incredible:
    Me: Ok ok ok so what did you think of The Thing At The End With Anders- crazy, right?
    Sis: Oh, well. I hated him so I always skipped all his dialogue and cutscenes. I didn't even realize that he had done something until the game gave me the option to stab him, which I did obviously. So what exactly happened again?
    Me: [INTERNAL SCREAMING]

  - From now on, you should skip all your dialogs with your sister
