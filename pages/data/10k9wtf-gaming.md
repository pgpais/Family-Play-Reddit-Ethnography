My wife will let the kids watch an hour of TV periodically, but if the kids and I play an hour of video games she treats me like I'm rotting their brains

How can I help her snap out of her archaic way of thinking?  And see that video games are beautiful art, inspiring, help build actual skills, help with problem solving, and are excellent for hand-eye coordination?  I'm just so sick of her poisoning my bonding time with the kids with braying negativity about video games.  

And for the record we only play once a week so it's not like we're playing every day or something.

My dad used to play video games with me.  He was in the military and deployed. alot.  You are still bonding and making memories.
