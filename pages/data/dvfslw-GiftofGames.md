	- Hi all!
	- I'll start with why I want this game.
	- I want this game for plenty of reasons, but 2 main reasons. First of all, to play with my dad. This is the essential reason I want to play. Back when civilization 3 was the newest edition of the game, at a time when I was very young, my dad would play it, and let me watch. It was a long time ago but it was a moment of happy bonding, a moment I could truly enjoy with my Dad. Since then, our relationship has deteriorated, not because we dislike each other, but because our interests have kind of diverted and his work is taking all his time on weekdays. However the other day I heard him talk about how Civilization 6 looked good but he wasn't sure it was worth the money. That's when me wanting to get the game really sparked, as I noticed it would be a moment to re consolidate our relationship. I know I could get some time with him on weekends, and I'm sure he'd love it, for the nostalgia, for being with me, for the game. The second reason is entirely based on me: I never really got to *play* Civilization as my dad was playing it and I didn't fully comprehend, but it led to me liking such games, especially simpler board games. I've seen game play of it, I've looked at reviews, and I think I'd absolutely love it, and probably spend too much time on it.

	- So these are the two reasons I want it: to re consolidate the relationship I have with my dad, and for my own personal fun.

	- Why I can't get it?
	- I've just gotten into 11th grade in a rather high tier school in a very work-intensive program, leading to the fact I can't make the same pocket money I used to - I still have some time to get money to be able to have lunches and stuff of course. You'll ask, how come you have time to play then? Well, because, I looked at my priorities, and said I could reduce my  money-making activities in order to increase work time, but without reducing play time as it allows me to relax and then re-focus on work once I've cleared my brain out. So, essentially, its an issue with money. I didn't buy it when I had money left-over because I didn't know I'd want it so bad.

	- I think this explains why I'm requesting the skin, why I want it and why I don't get it for myself.

	- Thank you ever so much to whoever takes me up on this offer
	- P.S. I believe it's on 70 percent discount, which is why I'm asking for it now, because I think 13.99 is more reasonable to ask for than 60. Don't take me wrong I totally understand that 13.99 is a lot ( which is why i can't afford it ) and it doesn't make the gift any less valuable.
	- Thank you so much!
