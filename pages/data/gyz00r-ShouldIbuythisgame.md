	- Hey guys, I want to buy a game for my little sister, she is a very  intelligent and mature teenage girl(14 years old), and she constantly shows interest in the video games that I and my brother play. Problem is, we both are mainly into text-heavy and very complex WRPGs, and my sister doesnt speak english well enough to play those games(There aren't any games translated to our language). We used to play Skyrim together but the boring writing would immediately  exhaust her.  So she wants games that have a great story, because that's what keeps her interested, but also do not require a lot of reading or a high level of english. As she is an aspiring artist, she values games that look good(not necesserily in a graphics sense, just plain nice aesthetics). Also, this must be a game that has a relatively simple gameplay, as she doesnt have much experience with video games and I cannot play with her and explain all the time, as I don't live at home.

	- I want to introduce her to games that fit this description(pretty specific, I know), could be old or new, doesnt matter. At ourr disposal at home is a pretty good PC, a Nintendo Switch and an old DS.
	- I'd love any help you guys can give. Thanks!
	- edit: Oh man, this is great! Thank you all, we got so many awsome suggestions, and I didnt expect to get so many upvotes :)))
	- As of now I have shown her GRIS, Ori, TWD, Bastion and Okami. We will see which she will choose. Her english isnt abysmal, she can understand most things spoken or written given enough time, but I am a bit worried about dialouge heavy games, especially ones with time limit such as telltale games. I guess we will try and know.
	- For those who suggested games for her to improve her english - I just don't want this to feel like a chore for her in any way, I want to expose her to games she will really enjoy. If she will start liking different kinds of games im sure she will learn english on her own, like I did :)))
	- Again thank you all so much!!!

	- Games like Ori and the Blind Forest and GRIS are pretty platformers that run on most hardware.
