Title
Stress free game for my pregnanat wife.

Post
Hey peeps.

My wife is pregnant. She also dealing with medical anxiety. Those two together sometimes makes her spiral into a mindset of problems and stress over having something serious. What has helped her a lot is keeping busy. Now that she has watched every TV series that interests her, she has played a little bit of games, and I downloaded Stardew Valley and she ate it up. She quickly had a big farm and had completed almost everything. 

What she has played before: 

* Stardew Valley
* Kingdoms Hearts (all of it) 
* Rayman (with me)
* Sims 

What she wants from games:

* Low-pressure games
* Games that have goals that you can work towards
* No FPS games or anything that requires a lot of accuracy
* Can be a little to complicated, but not puzzle games
* Single Player on the PS4

Hope you folk can help us.
