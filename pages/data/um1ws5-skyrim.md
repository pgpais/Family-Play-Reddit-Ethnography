Title
My wife started her play through and has been stealing everything.

Post
I mean everything. Bowls, baskets, cups you name it. She’s also been pickpocketing everyone she can. 

She spent a good 3 hours just stealing from Riverwood. I made a comment when I found her in the companions pickpocketing and she said “You should know better than fall asleep around me.” 

I’m scared.

Edit: thanks for all the love. She has played before and that’s why I was concerned lol. She DEFINITELY stole my heart as well.

Say to her "Never done an honest day's work in your life for all that coin you're carrying, eh lass?".
