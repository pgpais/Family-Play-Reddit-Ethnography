I'm just too proud and need to tell someone. My wife and I just beat the first level of Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance on Very Hard difficulty, each holding one side of the controller.

She held left and I held right. When it came to parrying we both had to be ready. Honestly, jumping over the UG's lazer at the end was the hardest part for some reason. But it only took us three tries. 

I'm just incredibly proud and wanted to share. Sorry if you guys don't care <3

Edit: We're going to record us doing it *again* just to show you guys because it's such a cool thing to me. Can't wait to post the video!

More edits: [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSQSrVS__cA) Is the video of us doing it. Hope you enjoy!
