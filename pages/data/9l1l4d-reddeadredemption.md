- Title
	- My mom is hyped for Red Dead
- Post
	- After playing the first Red Dead Redemption in my living room at the ripe old age of 9 years old. My mom would walk in and watch my play multiplayer. (My mom does not care for video games at all but this one actually interested her) One moment i remember especially was when i kept getting my account deleted on multiplayer so before i got it deleted i was level 40 something with decent guns and such. I went back on the game when she was watching and i told her "i was hacked" or some shit my 9 year old brain would say. I call my horse to check and ofc this dumbass donkey comes up and my mom couldn't stop laughing seeing my character ride around shooting at bandits and players on this stupid donkey.

	- Cut to yesterday i was explaining the games new mechanics and how much hype that's been going around about it and she asked when it was coming out and which i told her the 26th. She just told me that she'll "make it happen". Do mind me and her are pretty poor and buying a 60$ game is pretty difficult but god damn do i need this game and she can just tell by how enthusiastic i am about it that i really want this game. It really feels good when even your own mom can relate to you about hype over a video game. I love my mom and I can't wait to sit in the living room with her teaching her how to play and laughing when she fucks up or when she runs over someone with a horse she goes hysterical. Making me remember at the age of 9 how much fun i had doing simple things such as running over someone with a horse. Good Feels Man.
