Title
Until Dawn got my wife into gaming

Post
Up until last weekend, I was the only gamer in the house. My wife would make playful digs at me when I was in the "game room" with the headphones on and generally did not show much interest in playing anything. 

Last week, she came in there when I was playing Dishonored and just watched and asked questions about the characters and story and we both laughed at how big every character's hands are in that game. Anyway, she said she wanted to play something so I put in Ratchet and Clank but she could not get the dual joystick controls down. The last thing she played was Super Nintendo so the Joystick to walk and Joystick to move the camera thing messed her all up.

So we looked up some games for beginners on the ole' googler and Until Dawn was at the top of the list. If you're not familiar, it is a very cinematic horror game with limited controller involvement and we like shitty horror movies so we went and bought it from a local game store. 

She was hooked instantly. She finished the game in two sittings and has already restarted it making different decisions to see a different outcome. I also popped in GTA5 last night and she ran around as Trevor punching people in the face which is hilariously cathartic no matter who you are. We have an engagement party to go to this weekend and she's pissed because we can't "drink all the wine and play video games". 

So if you know someone that might like video games but has no skills or experience with them, I definitely recommend Until Dawn. It has a lot of jump scares in it and is creepy at times but it is entertaining. Plus you can kill off people that you don't like, and that's nice.

OP, keep in mind this is also her wanting to spend more time with you. Make the effort to get into her interests too, if you don't already.
