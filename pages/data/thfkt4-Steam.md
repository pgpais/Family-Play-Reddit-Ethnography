	- My mom wants to delete my account
- Post
	- Hello, today my mom has gotten really mad at me for playing on a friday night, in wich i usually relax after a week of school. After this my mom has tired to delete my steam account, but luckily i was able to change both my Steam and Google account passwords. Im afraid that, as she has access to my phone, she may be able to change my credentials and gain control of the account, wich would result in its deletion. ¿Can an account be deleted in the first place? ¿How can I further protect my accounts? Thx for the help in advance

	- Edit: thx for all of the advice, i have now secured my phone and laptop and she cannot access anything related with any of my accounts. Because of this she has cut of the internet to my laptop through the router settings (she studied computer science, so she cannot be tricked with the average stuff and is pretty skilled with computers) until I give my credentials to her. Now she says that she wants to change the password to ground me for a while, but i dont want to give her the ability to delete my account or mess with it when se gets a sudden urge. This may seem a bit extreme, wich has led many to believe that i was telling only part of the story, but really i am not (the only thing she could be mad for is that i recently scored 70% in a physics exam instead of my average 85%). She has done crazy thingds in the past. At the start of the school year she took my phone and gave me an Alcatel3088X instead, because "I shouldnt have any distractions" (says a person who goes to bed at 1AM because she is watching facebook and twitter). A couple of months she removed my bathroom door latch because she found me watching a series there. Again thx for the help

	- Remove mobile guard, create new e-mail if you feel like she has access to the old one, change steam account e-mail to new e-mail, change steam account password
	- Impossible for her to access it then
