	- I'm turning 40, I'm a passionate gamer and I wish people/family would stop saying I ruined my life.

	- TL;DR: tired of feeling bad for enjoying my hobby, anyone else have this issue?
	- I'm a pretty confident woman. My life has been far from perfect, but as I got older, the worry and stress of being what I thought everyone wanted me to be wore off little by little.
	- One day I stopped giving a damn all together.  Atleast I thought.
	- My first video game was Pong. My second was a text based RPG on an ancient Commodore. In the 80s, we got Nintendo and so on from there. I never lost my love for gaming. Thing is, I'm not just a gamer and it has not taken over my life.
	- I'm a classically trained musician with 33 years of performing/composing/teaching experience. For the last 10 of those years, I've also worked as a sound engineer for live shows across the globe to pay the bills. I paint, grow fruit tree saplings year round as gifts for the holidays, I bake and I've fostered homeless teens for years.
	- So what if I'm not married, who cares if I have kids, my sister had enough for the both of us. Whose business is it, other than mine, if I want to broadcast my gameplay or spend 100 hours on a game? ITS MY FREE TIME. Who cares if I bought an Atari shirt? ITS MY MONEY.

	- I'm a grown ass woman who owns her own house, pays her own bills, has a job she doesn't hate, teens to foster, and hobbies galore. Why is the gaming so offensive to people?
	- I enjoy it, I'm a beast when it comes to RPGs, I'm good at it and when life DOES become over-whelming? Well.....
	- Gaming is, hands down, the reason I don't need meds to get through the bad days, unlike any of my family or other female friends. All of them, ALL OF THEM, rely on multiple prescriptions just to function. The addictive kind. Uppers to wake up, opiods/xanax all day, downers for bed. Rinse and repeat. Yet I'm the one with a problem?

	- We always hear about guys giving girl-gamers crap, but honestly? It's my family and female friends that make me feel like an absolute waste of space for it.

	- How about you guys? Who gives you the most crap and how does it affect your love of the game? Thanks for reading!

	- Ah there it is. It doesn't matter if you had a different hobby, I have a feeling that 'you have ruined your life and is immature little girl' because you don't have kids. I am younger than you but not young, and I get this from people who have no idea I play games. It doesn't matter that I have a job, hobbies outside of gaming, friends. None of that matters at all. All that matters is how smug they are going to feel when I "finally grow up" and regret not fucking and squeezing out kids.
	- Trust me, the gaming thing is just an easier way to make you seem less mature or as the reason you are like that. I read books? well I need to take my head out of there and search for a man. I like dog frisbee? well playing with your own kids is sooo much better and I need to get on that asap. I work? well I should stop being selfish (???).
	- I didn't have the perfect life either. I love people but I have never been "in love", and up till a recent surgery I couldn't even have sex. People don't know me, don't know my life story - despite those people being my family, and then they give me crap for it.
