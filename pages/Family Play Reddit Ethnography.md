- # Motivation
	- While previous work has analyzed gaming in the context of families, it always did so in artificial contexts (i.e. interviews, laboratories, questionnaires). Other contexts (such as reddit communities) can provide further insight into what games families seek, how they discuss it and what constraints exist.
## Research Questions
	- **How are people talking about playing with their families, specifically in reddit communities ?**
	- What are the possibilities for promoting family play?
	- How are games used as a vehicle of communication and expression between family members?
	- How are gaming experiences constrained by the player's family?
# Study
	- ## Data Collection
		- ### Reddit
			- #### Data Collection/Selection
				- **Posts data was collected on [[Feb 14th, 2023]] **
				- **Comments data was collected on [[Mar 20th, 2023]] **
				- Analyse posts that talk about family-constrained experiences in gaming subreddits.
				- **Subreddit** selection:
					- Collection of reddit gaming communities provided by /r/Gaming with over 1000 entries.
					- The communities with more than 1000 posts are then sorted by number of relevant (i.e. posts with at least one of the keywords in their title) posts divided by total number of posts.
				- **Post** selection:
					- Select from first 20 posts of each subreddit
						- Select 10 posts maximum
						- Until we include 20 subreddits with at least 2 relevant posts
				- **Comment** selection:
					- Select the top-level comments of each selected post, sorted by "top" (most upvotes)
				- **Exclusion** criteria:
					- Exclude posts that:
						- Are obviously not related to digital gaming
						- Doesnâ€™t have gaming experiences shared with or constrained by family
						- Opportunities for family play
						- Not video
						  collapsed:: true
							- (gifs or videos shorter than 30 sec are allowed)
	- ## Data Analysis
		- ### Thematic Analysis
			- Two authors coded 10% of the selected content and discussed results. First author then coded the remaining content
			- Mentions of games were counted (max 1 per post) and more posts were included from these game's subreddits (how many posts? How many games?)
			- #### [[Codes]]
				- So far, codes are organized by:
					- How the experience is shared
					  collapsed:: true
						- [[Shared Experiences/Co-playing]]
						- [[Shared Experiences/Spectating/Active Spectating]]
						- [[Shared Experiences/Projecting game into Real life]]
						- [[Shared Experiences/Sense of wonder and novelty]]
					- Which media component the experience is being shared through
					  collapsed:: true
						- Have some doubts about when this could should be used
						  collapsed:: true
							- If I use every time they mention gameplay, for example, it might get muddied really fast (?)
						- [[Media Component/Gameplay]]
						- [[Media Component/Narrative]]
					- How family affects the experience
					  collapsed:: true
						- [[Affected by Family/Grief Affecting]]
						- [[Affected by Family/Facilitating others' entry]]
						- [[Affected by Family/Conform to play together]]
					- Social outcomes
					  collapsed:: true
						- [[Social Outcomes/Building Shared Memories]]
						- [[Social Outcomes/Shared Reminiscence]], [[Social Outcomes/Subverting Expectations]]
						- [[Social Outcomes/Finding Commonalities]]
						  collapsed:: true
							- How is this different from [[Parallel between Game and Life]]?
					- [[Learning Outcomes]] - probably irrelevant
					- [[Other Outcomes]]
					  collapsed:: true
						- encouraging grandpa to play for cognitive benefits
					- Personal aspects that affect experience
					  collapsed:: true
						- [[Personal Aspects/Skill Levels]]
						- [[Personal Aspects/Expertise or Familiarity]]
					- [[Game Accessibility]] - in terms of providing access to games (not disabilities)
					  collapsed:: true
						- [[Game Accessibility/Cultural Terms]]
						- [[Game Accessibility/Content Suitability]]
						- [[Game Accessibility/Cost]]
					- Entry points for non-gamers - some overlap a bit
					  collapsed:: true
						- [[Entry Point/Interest in theme or narrative]]
						- [[Entry Point/Another Medium]]
						- [[Entry Point/Connection with past]]
