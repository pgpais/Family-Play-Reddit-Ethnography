- # Motivation
	- While previous work has analyzed gaming in the context of families, it always did so in artificial contexts (i.e. interviews, laboratories, questionnaires). Other contexts (such as reddit communities) can provide further insight into what games families seek, how they discuss it and what constraints exist.
## Research Questions
	- **How are people talking about playing with their families, specifically in reddit communities ?**
	- What are the possibilities for promoting family play?
	- How are games used as a vehicle of communication and expression between family members?
	- How are gaming experiences constrained by the player's family?
# Study
	- ## Data Collection
		- ### Reddit
			- #### Data Collection/Selection
				- **Posts data was collected on [[Feb 14th, 2023]] **
				- **Comments data was collected on [[Mar 20th, 2023]] **
				- Analyse posts that talk about family-constrained experiences in gaming subreddits.
				- **Subreddit** selection:
					- Collection of reddit gaming communities provided by /r/Gaming with over 1000 entries.
					- The communities with more than 1000 posts are then sorted by number of relevant (i.e. posts with at least one of the keywords in their title) posts divided by total number of posts.
				- **Post** selection:
					- Select from first 20 posts of each subreddit
						- Select 10 posts maximum
						- Until we include 20 subreddits with at least 2 relevant posts
				- **Comment** selection:
					- Select the top-level comments of each selected post, sorted by "top" (most upvotes)
				- **Exclusion** criteria:
					- Exclude posts that:
						- Are obviously not related to digital gaming
						- Doesnâ€™t have gaming experiences shared with or constrained by family
						- Opportunities for family play
						- Not video
						  collapsed:: true
							- (gifs or videos shorter than 30 sec are allowed)
	- ## Data Analysis
		- ### Thematic Analysis
			- Two authors coded 25 (one for each subreddit) of the selected content and discussed results. First author then coded the remaining content
			- Mentions of games were counted (max 1 per post) and more posts were included from these game's subreddits (how many posts? How many games?)
			- #### [[Codes]]
			  collapsed:: true
				- So far, codes are organized by:
					- How the experience is shared
					  collapsed:: true
						- [[Shared Experiences/Co-playing]]
						- [[Shared Experiences/Spectating/Active Spectating]]
						- [[Shared Experiences/Projecting game into Real life]]
						- [[Shared Experiences/Sense of wonder and novelty]]
					- Which media component the experience is being shared through
					  collapsed:: true
						- Have some doubts about when this could should be used
						  collapsed:: true
							- If I use this every time someone mentions gameplay, for example, it might get muddied really fast (?)
						- [[Media Component/Gameplay]]
						- [[Media Component/Narrative]]
					- How family affects the experience
					  collapsed:: true
						- [[Affected by Family/Grief Affecting]]
						- [[Affected by Family/Facilitating others' play]]
						- [[Affected by Family/Conform to play together]]
					- Social outcomes
					  collapsed:: true
						- [[Social Outcomes/Building Shared Memories]]
						- [[Social Outcomes/Shared Reminiscence]]
						- [[Social Outcomes/Subverting Expectations]]
						- [[Finding Commonalities]]
						  collapsed:: true
							- How is this different from [[Parallel between Game and Life]]?
					- [[Learning Outcomes]] - probably irrelevant
					- [[Other Outcomes]]
					  collapsed:: true
						- encouraging grandpa to play for cognitive benefits
					- Personal aspects that affect experience
					  collapsed:: true
						- [[Personal Aspects/Skill Levels]]
						- [[Personal Aspects/Familiarity]]
					- [[Game Accessibility]] - in terms of providing access to games (not disabilities)
					  collapsed:: true
						- [[Game Accessibility/Cultural Terms]]
						- [[Game Accessibility/Content Suitability]]
						- [[Game Accessibility/Cost]]
					- Entry points for non-gamers - some overlap a bit
					  collapsed:: true
						- [[Entry Point/Interest in theme or narrative]]
						- [[Entry Point/Another Medium]]
						- [[Entry Point/Connection with past]]
			- #### Themes:
				- Is it possible to **categorise** what **social interactions** or dynamics **games can afford**?
				  collapsed:: true
					- For example (from the top of my mind): Stardew Valley is a relaxed game that gives you just enough to do to keep you focused on something, but not so much that it is the only reason for interaction. On the opposite side, something like League of Legends takes too much space in the conversation.
					- This ties in with the difficulty people have in selecting games
				- **Difficulty finding games** that can meet different people's preferences
				  collapsed:: true
					- A bit of a mouthful, but many posts are looking for a game to play with someone else, listing the preferences of each person, games they enjoyed or didn't (and some reasoning).
					- I'm not sure that there is any new information to add here, though. Besides that this problem exists.
				- **Gaming stigma still** prevalent to some extent, but some are able to overcome it
				- Many different ways to enjoy gaming (e.g. narrative, gameplay, visuals) provide **multiple entry points for "non-gamers"**
				- Games provide many **prompts for conversation**
				  collapsed:: true
					- How to design for this?
					- Can the length of games help?
						- Generally games are not finished in one play session, can that provide moments for discussion between players/spectators?
				- It is possible to play games (sequels, mostly) as a way of **remembering or paying homage to someone that has passed**
				- **Coping with hard times together** (or individually)
				  collapsed:: true
					- Not sure if I found escapism from toxic household?
				- Gameplay is interrupted by family randomly, but **games do not acommodate spontaneous breaks**
				  collapsed:: true
					- This is especially relevant in singleplayer games, but also happens in multiplayer games (how to acommodate spontaneous breaks in a match of LoL?)

					- I'm not sure if this family dynamic is worth capturing. And if it is, I'm unsure of how to code it. I was thinking of something like escapism?
				- {{embed [[hwo728-thelastofus]]}}
					- I coded part of this post as [[Gaming Stigma]] because I couldn't figure out another name to give it. It is not stigma per se, but any other code that I'd create would just be merged. What should I call it then?
				- {{embed [[c97c4k-gaming]]}}
					- Is there something here that I'm not capturing? I'm not sure that these codes are enough to capture how the parent is affecting the child's game
				- {{embed ((6450ed16-b39c-4130-b1f0-6fd33977c065))}}
					- Would Amiibos fit into this code?

			- #### Interesting Posts:
			  collapsed:: true
				- {{embed [[rujegi-skyrim]]}}
				- {{embed [[i1msn4-PS4]]}}
				- {{embed [[cpwmu4-xboxone]]}}
					- I think that wanting to talk without interrupting the game is something that many families go through. Especially with the rise of competitive games and how long they take to finish.
						- Personally, I know I've seen this issue many times in my household.
