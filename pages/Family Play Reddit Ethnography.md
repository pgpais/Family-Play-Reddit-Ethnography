- # Motivation
	- While previous work has analyzed gaming in the context of families, it always did so in artificial contexts (i.e. interviews, laboratories, questionnaires). Other contexts (such as reddit communities) can provide further insight into what games families seek, how they discuss it and what constraints exist.
## Research Questions
	- **How are people talking about playing with their families, specifically in reddit communities ?**
	- What are the possibilities for promoting family play?
	- How are games used as a vehicle of communication and expression between family members?
	- How are gaming experiences constrained by the player's family?
# Study
	- ## Data Collection
		- ### Reddit
			- #### Data Collection/Selection
				- **Posts data was collected on [[Feb 14th, 2023]] **
				- **Comments data was collected on [[Mar 20th, 2023]] **
				- Analyse posts that talk about family-constrained experiences in gaming subreddits.
				- **Subreddit** selection:
					- Collection of reddit gaming communities provided by /r/Gaming with over 1000 entries.
					- The communities with more than 1000 posts are then sorted by number of relevant (i.e. posts with at least one of the keywords in their title) posts divided by total number of posts.
					- Counted mentioned games from posts and fetched new posts from subreddits of these games
				- **Post** selection:
					- Select from first 20 posts of each subreddit
						- Select 10 posts maximum
						- Until we include 20 subreddits with at least 2 relevant posts
				- **Comment** selection:
					- Select the top-level comments of each selected post, sorted by "top" (most upvotes)
				- **Exclusion** criteria:
					- Exclude posts that:
						- Are obviously not related to digital gaming
						- Doesnâ€™t have gaming experiences shared with or constrained by family
						- Opportunities for family play
						- Not video
						  collapsed:: true
							- (gifs or videos shorter than 30 sec are allowed)
	- ## Data Analysis
		- Two authors coded 25 (one for each subreddit) of the selected content and discussed results. First author then coded the remaining content
		- Mentions of games were counted (max 1 per post) and more posts were included from these game's subreddits (how many posts? How many games?)
		- ### [[Codes]]
		  collapsed:: true
			- So far, codes are organized by:
				- How the experience is shared
					- [[Shared Experiences/Co-playing]]
					- [[Shared Experiences/Spectating/Active Spectating]]
					- [[Shared Experiences/Projecting game into Real life]]
					- [[Shared Experiences/Sense of wonder and novelty]]
				- Which media component the experience is being shared through
					- Have some doubts about when this could should be used
						- If I use this every time someone mentions gameplay, for example, it might get muddied really fast (?)
					- [[Media Component/Gameplay]]
					- [[Media Component/Narrative]]
				- How family affects the experience
					- [[Affected by Family/Grief Affecting]]
					- [[Affected by Family/Facilitating others' play]]
					- [[Affected by Family/Conform to play together]]
				- Social outcomes
					- [[Social Outcomes/Building Shared Memories]]
					- [[Social Outcomes/Shared Reminiscence]]
					- [[Social Outcomes/Subverting Expectations]]
					- [[Finding Commonalities]]
						- How is this different from [[Parallel between Game and Life]]?
				- [[Learning Outcomes]] - probably irrelevant
				- [[Other Outcomes]]
					- encouraging grandpa to play for cognitive benefits
				- Personal aspects that affect experience
					- [[Personal Aspects/Skill Levels]]
					- [[Personal Aspects/Familiarity]]
				- [[Game Accessibility]] - in terms of providing access to games (not disabilities)
					- [[Game Accessibility/Cultural Terms]]
					- [[Game Accessibility/Content Suitability]]
					- [[Game Accessibility/Cost]]
				- Entry points for non-gamers - some overlap a bit
					- [[Entry Point/Interest in theme or narrative]]
					- [[Entry Point/Another Medium]]
					- [[Entry Point/Connection with past]]
		- ### Data description
			- Gaming together can take many forms
				- Many posts of family spectating
					- Some describe how the spectator would comment the gameplay
				- Other posts mention "playing together" single player games
			- Interactions are mainly organically occurring
				- Moments of experience sharing are typically not planned. For example, someone walked into or is simply sharing the gaming space.
					- In this sense, a shared gaming space (where a console typically is) provides an "interaction generator" (terrible name, describe it differently).
						- Jesse Schell calls this type of gaming space the "Hearth" in [The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Game-Design-Lenses-Third-dp-1138632058/dp/1138632058)
			- These interactions can take many forms
				- They centered around aspects of the game itself (e.g. Narrative, visuals, gameplay). Some parents and children specifically mentioned how playing together created moments of bonding and promoted talking about things that would not be talked otherwise
				- See [[Shared Experiences]] hierarchy for details on what forms were found
		- ### Themes:
			- #### Satisfying different playing constraints
				- Families generally include people with different constraints.
				- preferences (e.g. Preferring slower games or games with fast, chaotic interactions)
					- Combining slower-paced and faster-paced preferences preferences
					- Content (e.g. gore, sex)
					  collapsed:: true
						- {{embed ((64512151-465c-49fb-b91a-08feb41accdb))}}
				- requirements (e.g. Time schedules, platforms, controls)
					- Skill Requirements
					  collapsed:: true

						- {{embed ((64512154-90d4-4d05-8f34-4e017a3f06e7))}}
					- Time schedules don't align
					- Small portions of time available
					- Language
					  collapsed:: true
						- {{embed ((64512152-caff-41cb-8561-79e31c682110))}}
			- #### Stereotyped views on games and gaming
			  collapsed:: true
				- Posters complained about stigma towards gaming. These biases can appear in different ways.
					- Some explained how their families saw games as an activity for children, describing how they are looked down on for playing in spite of how successful they might be in other aspects of life.
					- Others had conflicts with how games were portrayed as "dumb activities" or how they were a waste of time.
			- #### Experiencing games without playing them (spectating)
			  collapsed:: true
				- Playing games is not the only way to experience them. This can be seen in the posts we gathered, specifically how some families experienced games by having one person playing them and either spectating or discussing the experience with each other.
					- It is especially easy to experience narrative-focused games by spectating someone else playing. In these cases, discussion tends to be generated around major plot points or decisions the player has to make.
			- #### Initiating Play
				- It is important to understand how *gamers* introduce the medium to their fellow family members. This can inspire novel features that support sharing these experiences with less experienced players or people that do not play at all.
				- Games are generally too complex to introduce to someone not used to them

				- Connection with past
				  collapsed:: true
					- {{embed ((64512152-9b46-470f-8f50-fe49cd999fa0))}}
				- For other family members
					- Generally older parents.
					- Some already had experience with games
				- With other family members
					- Some posters asked for suggestions of games to play with other family members (e.g. spouses, children, parents).
						- Here, many exposed difficulties they felt when introducing games to others.
							- Mainly easiness to learn
							- Controls
							- Suitability of content (e.g. nudity, gore)
			- #### Forms of Shared experience.
				- Creating a connection with the person's past (e.g. fishing, being a mechanic, cowboy lifestyle)
				- Transitioning from a different medium (e.g. Last of Us tv show)
				- Connecting with each other through a shared activity
					- Discussion on why or how this is easier with games than other mediums?
						- Games tend to require active participation and cooperating promotes communication which is a good support for building relationships (*is this true?)*
			- #### Social interactions outside of gameplay caused by games
			  collapsed:: true

			- #### Negatives of Family Play(?)
			- Deprecated:
			  collapsed:: true
				- Is it possible to **categorise** what **social interactions** or dynamics **games can afford**?
				  collapsed:: true
					- For example (from the top of my mind): Stardew Valley is a relaxed game that gives you just enough to do to keep you focused on something, but not so much that it is the only reason for interaction. On the opposite side, something like League of Legends takes too much space in the conversation.
					- This ties in with the difficulty people have in selecting games
				- Shared gaming spaces
				  collapsed:: true
					- Tensions and opportunities
					- For discussion: the consequences of socioeconomic differences in families in this balance of tensions vs opportunities
